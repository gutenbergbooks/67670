<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Easter</span> was now fast approaching, and
Fitzhenry announced to Emmeline his
intention of going out of town for a fortnight,—but
not to Arlingford—And he
concluded by saying, that, of course, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>supposed she would like to pass the
time with her father at Charlton.</p>
<p class='c013'>At any other time, and under any
other circumstances, how gladly would
she have availed herself of the opportunity
of returning to her former, peaceful,
happy home! But, like a sick
person, her feverish mind had for some
time past dwelt on Arlingford. She
longed to find herself again there, for
there, they <i>must</i> meet—there they <i>might</i>
be alone! and she could not help hoping
for some explanation between them,
which might make her, at least, less
miserable. Fitzhenry’s manner towards
her had of late changed: it had no
longer the ease of indifference, the coldness
of mere civility; but, alas! it had
only changed to apparent dislike, or at
least displeasure. He observed her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>more; but his observations seemed always
to prejudice him still more against
her.</p>

<p class='c013'>And yet, what could she do? or what
leave undone? She had tried all means
to please him, and all had failed. She
first had followed the dictates of her own
heart, and then, relying on Pelham’s
knowledge of her husband’s character,
and on his advice, she had played a
part most unnatural to her—that of a
gay, unfeeling woman of the world,
when her heart was breaking. All, in
turn, seemed to be wrong.</p>

<p class='c013'>For an instant, a horrid thought had
crossed her mind. Could Pelham be
deceiving her? Could he, for any view,
either of his own, or Fitzhenry’s, be endeavouring
to draw her on to what was
lowering her still more in her husband’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>opinion? Was Pelham untrue to his
friend? or what would be still worse,
was it a concerted plan, to exasperate
her, and at last to force her to break a
connexion, which, to her husband, had
become intolerable thraldom. Emmeline,
shuddering, turned away from
such thoughts, almost reproaching herself
for ingratitude in having, even for a
moment, entertained them. But again
disappointed in what she had looked to
with some degree of satisfaction, and
finding she must relinquish even those
faint hopes which she had built, on their
return to Arlingford, her sick mind preyed
on itself, and conjured up these painful
surmises, producing doubt and suspicion
in the most confiding of all characters.</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline heard Fitzhenry’s notification
about leaving town in silent acquiescence;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>and, having no choice, to
Charlton she went; but her heart sank
within her as she drove up to her father’s
door, for, aware of how much she was
changed, she dreaded her parents’ observation,
and feared, that when constantly
in their society, she could not
keep up those false spirits which she always
endeavoured to assume when with
them. Poor Emmeline was in truth
sadly changed. Instead of the active,
cheerful being she used to be, she was
now generally abstracted, and sometimes
even apparently totally insensible
to every thing around her; and then,
when fearful of betraying herself, she
suddenly broke forth into those
unnatural bursts of feverish spirits, so
painful to witness, because so evidently
proceeding from internal suffering.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Mrs. Benson watched her in silent
anxiety; but her loss of bloom, of activity,
and appetite, even of spirits, all
was attributed to a far different cause;
and, after some enquiries respecting
her health, which Emmeline always
evaded, the warm-hearted mother, not
without smiling at her daughter’s overstrained
shyness and delicacy, questioned
her no more on the subject; but contented
herself with paying every possible
attention to her bodily comfort, while
she indulged in the delightful anticipation
of new objects for her maternal
pride and fondness.</p>

<p class='c013'>And thus deceived as to the cause of
Emmeline’s altered appearance, she
spared her any more embarrassing conversations.</p>

<p class='c013'>The stated fortnight was past, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>still she did not receive from Fitzhenry
the promised letter, announcing his return
to town. But one day the servant
put into her hand one with the Arlingford
post-mark. It was not franked by Fitzhenry;
the writing was unknown to her;
and, in alarm, she hastily broke the seal.</p>

<p class='c013'>She found it was from Brown, the
housekeeper, informing her that Reynolds
had been seized with a violent and
dangerous illness; that the doctors, who
attended him, gave little hope of his
recovery; and that he so constantly
expressed his anxiety to see her, and
Lord Fitzhenry, that she could not help
complying with his request, and informing
her ladyship of his situation and
wishes. She added—“I have also
taken the liberty to write to my lord;
and not knowing where his lordship is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>have sent the letter to the steward in
town to forward to him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline knew but too well whither
the letter would follow him; but thinking
he might not receive it in time, or
that, possibly, in the society he then
was, he might be little inclined to attend
such a summons, she determined immediately
to go to Arlingford. How much
the desire of being there, of visiting every
spot, every inanimate object in her mind
connected with Fitzhenry, and the possibility
even of thus meeting him, might
have influenced her benevolent decision—probably
she herself did not know.</p>

<p class='c013'>On arriving at Arlingford, Emmeline’s
first question was, whether Lord Fitzhenry
was there: and the feeling of deep
disappointment with which she learnt
that he was not, and that he was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>even expected, betraying to herself her
real object in coming, made her half-ashamed
when at length she enquired
after the poor invalid.</p>

<p class='c013'>The accounts of Reynolds’s situation
had been in no way exaggerated. He
was still alive, and sensible; but there
was no possibility whatever of recovery.
Emmeline therefore endeavoured to overcome
her own selfish feelings, and went
immediately to the sick room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Independent of the gratification she
received from witnessing the pleasure
which her presence seemed to give to the
faithful old servant, the duty she undertook
then was one every way better suited
to her present state of mind, than the dissipation
in which she had been lately engaged.
It soothed and quieted the tumult
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>of her feelings, and brought back to
her mind some of the innocent, calm remembrances
of happier days. Educated
by her mother in the exercise of every
religious duty, she, who had so lately
been seen glittering in ball rooms, now
knelt by the bed of sickness; and while
raising the dying man’s mind and hopes
to that better world to which he was
hastening, she found herself strengthened
to bear the sorrows of that, in
which she was still appointed to suffer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Towards the end of the second day
after Emmeline’s arrival at Arlingford,
Reynolds grew rapidly worse; the symptoms
of death seemed to be fast increasing,
and, aware of his approaching dissolution,
his anxiety for Fitzhenry’s
arrival, and the nervous perturbation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>his mind, were painful to witness. Emmeline
frequently asked if he had any
request to make, any wish she could
communicate to him; but his only answer
was, that he must see him before
he died.</p>

<p class='c013'>To compose, and turn his thoughts to
other things, Emmeline had again recourse
to religion; and, when thus employed,
and while the last rays of the
evening sun shone faintly through the
curtains of the sick room on her kneeling
figure, and on the sacred book she held
in her hand, the door of the apartment
slowly opened, and Fitzhenry appeared.</p>

<p class='c013'>He started back on seeing Emmeline,
and, for a moment, stood still, as if awed
by the scene before him; but Reynolds
recognizing him, and exclaiming—“’Tis
him! God be praised, I shall now die in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>peace,” Fitzhenry hastened up to him,
kindly taking his extended hand; then
again looking at Emmeline—“Good
God! Lady Fitzhenry, since when have
you been here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Only a day or two; I was sent for,”
said Emmeline, hardly knowing whether
thus unexpectedly seeing her had
given him pain or pleasure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was so bold as to send for her
ladyship,” said Reynolds. “It was my
request, my dying request. I knew I
had not long to live. I knew I should
not die easy, unless I could once more
see you, once more see that angel!”
and still grasping Fitzhenry with one
hand, he held out the other to Emmeline.</p>

<p class='c013'>At such a moment, not to comply with
any wish of the sick man, was impossible;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>though, half fearful of his intention,
she tremblingly put her hand in
his.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear, dear Lord Fitzhenry,” continued
Reynolds, “you know I love you
as if you were my own son. Death
makes us all equal, and it makes me
bold. I have often wished, longed, to
speak to you, but felt it was not my
place; and I had not courage; but
listen to a dying man’s advice. I know
all—you know I do. Oh, my dear
master! repent, and turn from your
evil ways! Do not any longer trifle
with God, and with the happiness he
has offered you! Do not cast from you
the angel Heaven has sent you!”—and
he joined their hands. “God of heaven!”
he continued, with a trembling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>voice, “look down on these, thy servants,
and make them happy together!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Fitzhenry’s head fell on the bed, as if
wishing to avoid the eyes of Emmeline,
as he involuntarily sunk on his knees.</p>

<p class='c013'>As for Emmeline, overcome and terrified
at what had passed; fearful as to the
manner in which Fitzhenry might interpret
such a seemingly premeditated
appeal to his feelings in her behalf; perhaps,
even, humbled at the situation in
which it placed her, she hastily, almost
unconsciously, withdrew her hand from
the feeble grasp of the dying man, while
his dimmed eyes were still raised to heaven;
and, before either he, or her husband,
had time to discover her intention,
she hastily left the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>But she had no sooner quitted it than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>she repented her hasty flight. When Reynolds
joined their hands, although Fitzhenry
had not clasped hers in token of
affection, still he had suffered his to remain
with it; and, overcome by the old
man’s address to him, he had appeared to
have given way to the kind—the virtuous
impulse of the moment. That impulse,
and those virtuous feelings, might possibly
have produced a favourable explanation;
and she, by leaving him so abruptly,
had now, she feared, evidently shown a
reluctance to any thing which might have
produced a reconciliation between them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Twice she had her hand on the lock
to return; but, timid from excess of
affection, each time her courage failed
her. The door which she had scarcely
closed, reopened of itself, and she heard
these words uttered by Fitzhenry: “It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>is impossible—indeed it can’t be so;—but
depend upon it, nothing shall be
wanting on my part to contribute to her
happiness, and——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline waited for no more. As
one pursued by a horrid vision, she hurried
to her own room. The shades of
evening deepened around her, as, alone
and half stupified with her various feelings,
she counted the striking of the
heavy hours as they passed. Not a
sound was to be heard in the uninhabited
house—no one came near her.</p>

<p class='c013'>At length, when the clock slowly,
solemnly sounded twelve, she started
up, and, recollecting that her maid was
probably waiting for her, she rung the
bell, that she might dismiss her for the
night; but she first sent her to enquire
after Reynolds, whose room was in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>distant part of the building. On the
return of Jenkins, the report she brought
was—“That my lord was still with
Reynolds—that they were apparently
engaged in serious conversation—for that
no one was allowed to go into the room,
my lord himself giving him the necessary
medicines, and having dismissed the
nurse.”</p>

<p class='c013'>After her maid had taken off Emmeline’s
gown, unplaited her hair, and, at her
desire, lit the fire in her dressing-room,
as she fancied it would be a sort of companion
to her, which, in her present state
of mind, she felt to be necessary, she sent
Jenkins to bed, and, drawing her chair
close upon the hearth, Emmeline remained
lost in reflections neither cheering
nor soothing. The near neighbourhood
of a death-bed gives an awful feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>even to one in the full pride of youth
and health. To be aware that so
close to us a fellow-creature is probably
just then passing, through the agonies
of death, to that eternity to which we
all look with awe, is an overpowering
sensation; and Emmeline shuddered as
these thoughts crossed her mind. She
cast her eyes fearfully round the room,
and endeavoured to brighten the flame
in the grate. Still death and its horrors
hung over her imagination, which wandered
now to future scenes of pain and
punishment; and the thought that Fitzhenry—her
loved Fitzhenry, who had
wound himself round every fibre of her
heart—might perhaps be an outcast from
that heaven to which she had been taught
to look, as the end and aim of her existence,
was agony. For she could not conceal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>from herself that he was living in
bold defiance, or rather in total disregard
and indifference to the will and laws of
his God.</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline’s blood curdled, and a cold
shiver crept all over her frame. Instinctively
she sunk on her knees, and prayed
for him who had never been taught to
pray for himself. Her head sank on her
clasped hands, which rested on a chair
beside her; her long hair falling over
her face and shoulders. The dead silence
that surrounded her, appalled her awe-stricken
mind; she eagerly listened for
some sound of human existence and neighbourhood;
but nothing was to be heard
but the regular vibration of the great clock
in the hall. Emmeline remained kneeling,
till her nervous agitation grew so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>painfully strong, that she hardly dared to
move, and had not power to shake off the
superstitious horror which had taken possession
of her. Every limb trembled;
the cold sweat stood on her forehead;
and it was an inexpressible relief to her
disordered mind, when, at length, she
heard a slow step in the gallery, and a
gentle knock at her door. She concluded
it was her maid, bringing her
some tidings of Reynolds, and she
quickly and joyfully bade her enter.
The door softly opened, and Fitzhenry
appeared.</p>

<p class='c013'>An unearthly vision could scarcely
have startled Emmeline more. She
uttered an exclamation, almost of terror,
as she hastily rose from her knees; but
almost directly sank into the chair beside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>her, her trembling limbs refusing
to support her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think you gave me leave to come
in,” said Fitzhenry, still standing at the
door. Emmeline bowed assent, when,
closing it after him, he came up to her,
and put his candle on the mantle-piece.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the first time he had ever entered
her room since that day when, on
her parents’ first arrival at Arlingford,
he had conducted them to it; and, dreading
the possible purport of his visit <i>now</i>,
after the scene that had lately occurred,
she had not courage to say a word. For a
minute, both were silent—at length Fitzhenry
said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thought you would be anxious to
hear about poor Reynolds; and as he
has now sunk into something like sleep,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>I came away for a minute to tell you he
is more easy and composed; but I fear
this stupor is only the forerunner of
death, and that all will soon be over. I
shall lose a most faithful servant—indeed,
an attached friend—.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He paused; but Emmeline, still too
nervous to speak, said nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I also came,” said he, in an agitated,
hurried manner, “to thank you for your
kindness in coming to him: it was most
kind—good—excellent;—like yourself.
I feel it deeply, I assure you, as well as
Reynolds.”</p>

<p class='c013'>These few words of praise, so unlike
what she had expected from him after
what had passed, still more overpowered
Emmeline. Had she dared to give way
to the feelings of the moment, she would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>have thrown herself into her husband’s
arms, and, in his tenderness, claimed a
reward for an action which he seemed to
take as a kindness to himself. But alas!
not for one moment could she be deceived
as to the nature of <i>his</i> feelings; not for
one moment, after the decisive declaration
which she had again heard him make,
could she attribute his present manner
towards her to any thing but mere gratitude
for her attentions to his old servant;
and, repressing the throbbings of her bosom,
and scarcely knowing what she said,
with a breathless voice she answered:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I came to Arlingford because I
thought Brown’s letter might not reach
you in time, and I did not know where
to write to you—I mean, I thought you
might be otherwise engaged yourself.”——And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>then struck with the appearance of
coldness and reproof in her words, and
the possible interpretation to be given to
them, she stopped short.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fitzhenry made no comment. Both
were now standing seemingly occupied
with watching the dying embers of the
fire—at last he turned towards her, she
felt his eyes were on her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor Reynolds often names you,”
he said; “but I think, unless you wish
it—perhaps you had better not go to him
again—such scenes are painful, and——”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was continuing, but with the quick
touchiness of love, (of unrequited love,
which interprets every thing to its disadvantage,)
Emmeline, catching at those
words, and fancying they alluded to what
had lately passed, and were meant as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>hint to her to avoid any possible recurrence
of the same scene, immediately,
with a voice scarcely audible from agitation,
said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh no, certainly. And perhaps now
that you are here, and that my presence
is no longer desired—I mean not necessary—it
may be more convenient if I
return to Charlton——or to town.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just whatever you prefer,” said Fitzhenry,
coldly; and, after a moment’s
pause, “you know my wish is, that you
should always do whatever you like and
judge to be best.” And he put up his
hand to take his candle, as if in preparation
to leave the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Emmeline had, in a moment of
perhaps excusable irritation, artfully
made the proposal of leaving Arlingford,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>in the hope of its being opposed; and
this cold acquiescence quite overcame
her. She could not speak, for her lips
quivered when she attempted it; and,
depressed and nervous with all that had
passed, big tears again rolled down her
cheeks, and she kept her head averted
to conceal them from Fitzhenry.</p>

<p class='c013'>In raising his hand to take his candle,
he somehow had caught on the button of
his coat-sleeve a lock of her long hair,
which was hanging loose over her
shoulders; and, during the pause that followed
his answer, he was endeavouring
to disentangle himself; but in vain.
Surprised at his still remaining near her,
and in silence, she at last looked up, and
seeing what had happened, her trembling
hands darted on the entangled hair, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>with the vehemence of vexation, she
broke and untwisted it till she again set
him free. He looked at her for a minute
in seeming astonishment, and then, coldly
wishing her good-night, left the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had scarcely been gone a minute,
when recalling the kindness of his manner
on first entering, and blaming herself
for the irritation she had given way to,
she determined to recall him; and, passing
from one extreme to another, and
buoyed up with instant hope—though she
scarcely knew of what—she hastily collected
her hair with a comb, folded her
wrapper closer around her, and opening
her door, hurried into the gallery. All
there was dark and silent; she turned towards
Fitzhenry’s room—his door was
open—but he was gone! Stopping a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>minute to listen and take breath, she
heard him crossing the hall below on
his way to Reynolds’s apartment. She
determined to recall him, and hurried
along the gallery to the head of the stairs
for that purpose. When she got there,
she saw the last faint ray of the light he
was carrying glimmering across the hall.
Twice she endeavoured to pronounce his
name—but it was a name that never could
be pronounced by her calmly. She was
frightened at the sound of her own voice,
faint as its accents were, (so faint that
they never reached him to whom they
were addressed,) and her courage totally
failed her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Alas!” thought she, as she sadly
leant against the bannisters for support,
“if he came, what could I say to him?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>what have I to ask of him, but pity for
feelings which he can neither understand
nor return? and may I at least never so
far forget myself. I am humbled enough
already.” And now, even alarmed at
what those feelings had so nearly betrayed
her into, she returned to her own
room as hastily as she had a minute before
quitted it; so capricious, so inconsistent
does passion render its victims.</p>

<p class='c013'>Towards dawn of day, Emmeline,
whose heavy eyes sleep had never
visited, heard a bustle below; several
doors were hastily opened and shut. In
a little time, Fitzhenry (for she could
never mistake <i>his</i> step) passed hastily
along the gallery to his own room, and
closed the door immediately after him.
Then there was again a dead silence.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“It is all over,” thought Emmeline;
“Reynolds is at peace: the only being
in this house who loved me is gone!”
A cold shiver crept over her; she buried
her tear-bedewed face in her pillow, and
thus lay for long immoveable, no conscious
thought passing through her agitated
mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>When her maid came to her in the
morning, she informed her Reynolds had
died about five o’clock; that Lord Fitzhenry
had never left him; that he had
supported him in his arms to the last,
and, when all was over, appearing much
affected, he had gone immediately to his
own room, giving orders that no one was
to go to him till he rung.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jenkins, unbidden, brought Emmeline
her breakfast in her own apartment, although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>at Arlingford that was a meal at
which she and Fitzhenry had always
hitherto met. How painfully did she
then feel the separation between them!
Fitzhenry was in sorrow, and she, his
wife, dared not go near him; even the
servants seemed to dictate to her her
conduct, and to be aware of her situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>As to her departure, she knew not what
to determine. She had said she would
go. Her husband had not opposed her
declared intention, and she did not like
again to be accused of caprice. Not
feeling, however, that she could leave
Arlingford without at least again seeing
him, she put off her journey till the
following day.</p>

<p class='c013'>To pass the slow unoccupied hours,
Emmeline, knowing there was no chance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>of seeing Fitzhenry for some time, wandered
out. The country was now in its
first freshness of beauty—all smiled
around her. Those rides and paths
which, the summer before, she had first
seen, with Fitzhenry at her side, were
again clothed in the lovely green of
spring. Often at those spots, connected
in her mind with some circumstance,
word, or even look of Fitzhenry, which
a few months back had, although in delusion,
made her heart sometimes beat
with the flattering hope that she was not
quite indifferent to him, poor Emmeline
would remain fixed, quite unconscious
of the time she thus passed in vague
reverie. For, compared with what she
had endured in London, there was a sort
of pleasure in her present state of mind,
raised and soothed as it had been, by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>late pious duties in which she had been
engaged, and softened by the charm of
renovated nature. How often does some
accidental sound or perfume, wafted to
us on a spring breeze, startle the mind
by confused recollections of hours gone
by, and by undefinable sensations of
mixed pain and pleasure!</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline had not been long returned
to the house before a servant came and
told her that dinner was ready, and that
my lord was waiting for her. Their
meeting was rather awkward on both
sides. Fitzhenry never raised his eyes
upon her; but she was now well used to
that sort of cold neglect on his part. It
was the first time for several months that
they had been <i>tête-à-tête</i>. This circumstance,
and the room they were in, all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>brought back forcibly to Emmeline’s
mind their wedding-day; that day of
exultation and joy to her parents, and at
its dawn of hope and happiness even to
herself—and how had it all ended!</p>

<p class='c013'>To one formed for tenderness, for all
the social charities of life, there could
not be a more cheerless fate than hers;
for, repulsed from where her heart should
have found its best home, she was even
denied the consolations of confidential
friendship. Occupied with these thoughts,
Emmeline was little inclined to join in
uninteresting, forced conversation. Fitzhenry,
too, seemed much depressed, and
they ate their repast in nearly total
silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>When it was ended, Fitzhenry, under
the plea of having several orders to give,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>and many things to arrange in consequence
of the death of Reynolds, soon
returned to his own room, and Emmeline
passed the remainder of the evening
alone. On the approach of midnight,
as he never appeared, she concluded that
Fitzhenry did not intend to return; she
therefore rang for her candle, and left the
drawing-room; but before she reached her
own apartment, she was met in the gallery
by her husband—they both stopped.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall leave this place to-morrow,”
said Emmeline, in a low voice. “Have
you any letters or orders to send by me?”
She still fondly hoped he would make
some objection to her departure; but he
merely replied, that he concluded she
was going to Grosvenor-Street; that he
would follow in a few days; and that if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>she did not set out early, he would send
some letters by her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can go at any hour,” said Emmeline,
“I am in no hurry; it does not
signify at what time I go; all hours are
the same to me.” And so they parted.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was in the same cold, distant manner
that they separated next morning,
when Emmeline left Arlingford for town.
For though she loitered on, always hoping
Fitzhenry would let fall some word at
which she might catch as an encouragement
to stay, he never in any manner
opposed her departure; and at last, with
a heavy heart, she entered her carriage,
and, after a melancholy, solitary journey,
drove over London’s noisy pavement,
now glazed by a burning May sun, into
Grosvenor-Street.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Those who have lived in London when
melancholy circumstances have excluded
them from participating in its amusements,
will enter into Emmeline’s feelings
when, during the first, and on many
an ensuing dismal evening, which she
spent alone, she heard the carriages
hurry past her door in the constant bustle
of pleasure. Often, as she sat in the dusk
of the now long-protracted spring evenings,
Emmeline was only roused from
some deep reverie to a consciousness of
the lateness of the hour, by the glare of the
lamps and flambeaux of some of these
gay equipages passing her darkened windows,
and hastening to some general
resort of diversion.</p>

<p class='c013'>For it was now the high tide, the carnival
of London. Every one was there——and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>every one went every where—hurrying
and crowding after each other, although
caring for no one. What a
wretched, humiliating picture of human
nature does London present during the
months of May, June, and July! Affection,
friendship, all the social virtues, and
charities, disappear before folly, dissipation,
and selfishness. And so infectious
is the disease, that almost the best hearts
are, at least for the moment, tainted; the
steadiest heads turned. It is a constant
hurry, a perpetual bustle, in which no one
has leisure to care, or feel for another,
whatever may be the inclination; and
scarcely is there time to drop a tear over
the grave of a friend. If an uncle, cousin,
or some such near relation, is so inconsiderate
as to choose these interesting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>busy moments to depart this life, it is
looked upon as an almost unpardonable
act of selfishness on the part of the defunct,
by which so much time, perhaps
many entertainments and balls, are lost
to his surviving family. On the other
hand, the demise of some mere nightly
companion in the resorts of dissipation
is generally hailed with joy, not for their
own demerits, but that not only <i>their</i>
opera-box and ticket at Almacks, but
that of all those nearly connected with
them will thereby become disposable;
a short retirement being considered necessary
both to dry their tears, and
give time to a fashionable tailor or
mantua-maker to send home the becoming
mourning, in which they can again
sally forth to make up for the time they
have lost, by returning with renovated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>spirits to their dissipated duties. In the
mean time, anxious notes fly about town
as soon as the death is announced in the
papers; and the doors of all the patronesses
of fashion are beset by the dear
friends of the deceased, anxious to be
the first to apply for the vacated subscription,
which happily can neither be
carried away from this world by the
selfish, nor be disposed of by will by the
obliging.</p>

<p class='c013'>And this was the world into which
poor Emmeline had to carry a breaking
heart!</p>

<p class='c013'>After Fitzhenry had joined her in
town, although nothing further had ever
passed,—no dispute, no difference had
taken place,—yet, they appeared mutually
to consider themselves as more
than ever, in short, totally estranged.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Both looked miserable: an additional
shade of melancholy seemed to have
gathered on Lord Fitzhenry’s countenance;
and yet Emmeline was now
certain that her rival was again in town,
and that he passed with Lady Florence
those hours which she now spent alone
in Grosvenor-Street. For Emmeline
felt it impossible to return to her former
life; and, as there was no reason why she
should, no one for whom she was called
upon to make the exertion, she gave
up what had already injured her health,
both of mind and body.</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline’s temper even was not what
it used to be; often, if Fitzhenry accidentally
spoke to her, she answered him
with asperity, and then the minute he
had disappeared, she wept bitterly for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>her fault—for her offence towards love;
longing for his return, that, on her knees,
she might implore his forgiveness. Yet,
when they again met, it was the same
repulsive coldness on both sides.</p>

<p class='c013'>But if there can ever be an excuse for
one gifted by nature with the blessing
of a mild, gentle disposition, for giving
way to irritation, Emmeline might
plead it. Her heart was every way
wounded; even Pelham she now dreaded;
Mrs. Osterley’s hints eternally
haunted her: if she caught his eye fixed
upon her in anxious interest, her sick
fancy took alarm, and the deep crimson
in her cheeks betrayed apprehensions,
which she wished to conceal even from
herself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tormented with this idea, she now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>shunned his society and conversation, as
much as she had formerly sought it;
for, although her extreme diffidence
with regard to her own attractions, (a
diffidence which her husband’s disregard
of her had much increased,) her unsuspecting
innocence, and simplicity of
heart, would rather have led her to prize
than avoid the attentions of an agreeable
man, regardless of their raising
suspicions in the breast of others, any
more than in her own; yet, now being
aware of what the world <i>could</i> and <i>did</i>
say, that very innocence and simplicity
made her fly from the least appearance
of evil. She was not one of those to
play off on a husband the arts of infidelity,
in order, by jealousy, to rouse
his feelings, and by the fear of wounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>honour, to attract his attentions towards
her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fitzhenry cared not for her; but the
vow of constancy which her lips had
pronounced at the altar, and which was
since engraven by strong affection on
her heart, was too sacred in her estimation
to allow even the uninterested
world to suspect that she trifled with it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Her intercourse with Pelham being
thus embittered, and her parents being
the last to whom she could reveal her
sorrows, she dragged on, in wretched
solitude of heart, a listless, useless,
aimless existence. The young, the gay,
and the busy meantime bustled around
her, careless of her unhappiness; or, if
they sometimes observed its melancholy
symptoms on her pale cheek, or in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>heavy, absent eye, they only wondered
“what could make Lady Fitzhenry so
discontented, when she possessed every
thing in the world to render her happy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It is thus we too often pass harsh and
hasty judgment on those whose grave or
suffering countenances chance to cross
us in the paths of pleasure, checking,
for a minute, by their sad and therefore
unwelcome presence, our feeling of enjoyment,
in reminding us, most disagreeably,
of its transient nature.</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Emmeline</span> having a general invitation
to the house of Lady Mowbray—one of
her new acquaintance, who was <i>at-home</i>
on a stated day every week; and never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>having yet been to any of her <i>soirées</i>,
she one evening exerted herself to pay
her a visit. There were not many people
assembled, owing to the <i>many things
to be done</i>, a phrase in the fashionable
slang of London, expressive of that
delightful prospect of busy pleasure,
which consists in passing the greatest
part of the night in a carriage, fighting
in and out of a dozen houses, the owners
of which are, perhaps, never seen by
their visitors.</p>
<p class='c013'>Among the few whom these many
pleasures had that evening spared to
Lady Mowbray, Emmeline found none
with whom she was much acquainted;
so that after having remained what she
thought a sufficient time, hearing a loud
knock, announcing a fresh reinforcement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>of company, and thinking she had performed
her duty of civility, she meditated
her departure, when the door opened, and
Lady Florence Mostyn was announced.</p>

<p class='c013'>At that name, Emmeline started so
violently, that her neighbour turned
round to see what had alarmed her;
but could neither perceive any cause for
her agitation, nor receive any answer to
her enquires, whether she was well, for
Emmeline’s eyes, thoughts, and every
sense, were fixed on her rival.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Florence, after speaking to one
or two other people, went up to Lady
Mowbray, and seated herself by her,
luckily at some distance from where
Emmeline was placed. Lady Florence
was past the first bloom and beauty of
youth; but this was more apparent in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>the somewhat thickened contour of her
figure, than in her face. Her deep blue
eyes were still brilliant; her lovely chiselled
mouth still opened to show teeth
like pearls, and the roses and lillies still
contended in her cheeks. She was simply
dressed; but there was not a curl,
however careless it appeared, but fell just
where it should, and the large shawl in
which she was wrapped, took some new
graceful fold each time she moved, and
by its brilliant colours gave additional
effect to the delicate whiteness of a
round arm, covered with bracelets. Her
voice, and look, were sweetness itself;
but in her eyes, an expression
lurked, that recalled to the mind, Walter
Scott’s “Wiley Dame Heron.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Lost in a trance of most painful feelings,
Emmeline sat for some time
like a statue, without power to form
any resolution, as to whether she would
fly or face her enemy. <i>There</i> was the
being who reigned paramount in her
husband’s heart! Those were the eyes
on which he gazed with fondness! on
that hand he had sworn constancy!
on those lips he had sealed his vows!
the silver tones of that voice thrilled to
<i>his</i> heart, as his did to hers!</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Emmeline gazed on all these
charms, till, growing frightened at her
own increasing agitation, she hastily got
up, and moved towards the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dear Lady Fitzhenry,” exclaimed
Lady Mowbray, who unfortunately
had observed her intended departure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“I hope you are not already
going?”</p>

<p class='c013'>At that name, the eyes of Lady Florence
eagerly followed those of the speaker,
and rested on Emmeline. And, for
an instant, as if impelled by some power
they could not resist, the rivals glanced
at each other, and their eyes met. But
Emmeline’s soon fell beneath the scrutiny,
and she turned away her
death-like face. The whole expression
of Lady Florence’s countenance had
changed. Emmeline’s appearance, every
way so different from what she had expected,
in an instant roused, within her,
feelings she could scarcely command.
Her uncontrolled passions were plainly
painted in her face; the deep crimson
in her cheeks overcame the well applied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>rouge; her eyes flashed fire; and the
lovely smile on her lips, was replaced by
a fearful expression of “envy, hatred,
and malice.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline, scarcely able to support
herself, and endeavouring to utter some
excuse, still moved towards the
door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, really you are using me very
shabbily,” said Lady Mowbray, in reply
to her uncertain accents, and following
her with most officious civility. “But
I know this is the moment when it is
impossible to keep any body for half an
hour; and quiet, sober people, like myself,
have no chance of collecting anything
like agreeable society. I suppose
you are going to the D——e house,
or some such gay thing.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Emmeline stammered out, that she
was obliged to go home.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Home! I fear you are not well,” retorted
Lady Mowbray, now, for the first
time, observing her blanched cheek, and
bloodless lips. “Do at least wait till you
hear that your carriage is ready:” and,
cruelly well bred, she rang the bell, enquiring
repeatedly whether Emmeline
would not be prevailed upon to take
something.</p>

<p class='c013'>Unable to speak, she shook her head
in answer, and the instant the welcome
sound of her own name reached her
ears, she darted out of the room, though
still followed by the civilities and offers
of the lady of the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>When in her carriage, and when too
late, Emmeline remembered Pelham’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>often repeated advice, to endeavour to
control, or, at least conceal, her feelings
better. She was aware she had humbled
herself before her, who, of all people,
she would least wish should read those
feelings; and she felt also that she had
left herself and her husband subjects for
animadversion, certainly not of the most
charitable nature. But poor Emmeline,
in common with all those who allow their
affections to control their judgment,
never, till too late, discovered what her
conduct should have been—an artlessness
of disposition, ill-calculated to contend
with a guileful world.</p>

<p class='c013'>This evening’s adventure completely
sickened her of the amusements of London;
and aware from constant, sad experience,
of her inability to perform her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>hard part properly, she resolved to avoid
in future the possibility of any recurrence
of such scenes; for though her mind had
long been intent on meeting Lady Florence,
from a sort of anxious, jealous
curiosity, yet now she felt she could
not endure the trial again; and, that
weakened both in health and spirits,
she was no longer equal to the exertions
which she knew she should make. She
remained, therefore, in spite of Lady
Saville’s repeated attacks and railleries,
for some time entirely at home; and,
catching gladly at an excuse for avoiding
even the opera, she gave away her box
the following week, to some Hampshire
neighbours, who she heard were in
town; and the weather being uncommonly
hot, she had, on the Saturday,
ordered her carriage, after her solitary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>dinner, to take a drive out of town, in
the hope that a little fresh air might revive
and compose her spirits.</p>

<p class='c013'>But just as she was going, a note arrived
from Lady Saville, to say, that
she was disappointed of a friend, with
whom she was to have gone to the opera,
that night, and, who being now unavoidably
prevented, had made over the box
to her, but her carriage being broken,
and having no one to go with, she would
be obliged to give up the plan entirely,
unless Emmeline would be compassionate
and carry her; and she entreated she
would overcome her abominable laziness,
and agree to the proposal—adding, it was
the new opera, and that it would do her
good, for she gave herself the blue devils,
by moping so much at home.</p>

<p class='c013'>Too indifferent to every thing, even to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>refuse, Emmeline gave up her intended
drive, changed her dress, and she and
Lady Saville went together to the opera.</p>

<p class='c013'>About the beginning of the second
act, she saw Lady Florence come into a
box on the same tier, about ten or twelve
off; she was alone—and at that distance,
Emmeline thought would probably
not recognize her; but, wishing
to conceal herself from her view, she
made some apology to Lady Saville for
being whimsical, and, begging to change
places with her, she moved to the opposite
seat, drawing the curtain of the box so
as entirely to hide herself; although,
like the poor bird ensnared by the serpent,
she never could withdraw her eyes
from her rival.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before long, a man entered the box
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>where Lady Florence was; he seated
himself directly with his back towards
Emmeline; but it was impossible for <i>her</i>
to mistake him;—the oval head, the
brown, curly hair, the attitude and air
of the arm that leant on the edge of the
box, the action of the hand, all told her
but too well it could only be Fitzhenry.</p>

<p class='c013'>Never before had she beheld them together;
never before had she, in a manner,
witnessed those words, those looks
of love, addressed to Lady Florence,
which should now have belonged to her.
Though but too well aware of the whole
truth, she had as yet suffered merely
from a vague, unembodied feeling of
jealousy. She had been wounded by
neglect; by the mortifying conviction that
she was not beloved by her husband; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>had never yet actually witnessed his demonstrations
of love to another.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Florence leant towards Fitzhenry,
and seemed to whisper something
to him. He shook his head, as if contradicting
her; but soon after, Emmeline
saw him look round towards the box
where she was, with a glass, as if in
search of some one. She hastily, although
she hardly knew why, shrunk
back, hiding herself behind the curtain,
which she drew still more forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>They then appeared to be engaged in
most earnest conversation for some time,
till at length Fitzhenry, leaning back in
his chair, sat with his hand over his face,
and there seemed to be a total silence
between them. Ere long, a third person
came into the box. Fitzhenry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>then moved from his place, and disappeared.</p>

<p class='c013'>To those who have known the torments
of jealousy, I need not describe
Emmeline’s feelings; and to those who
have not, my expressions would appear
exaggerated and unnatural. Like a statue,
she sat during the remainder of the
opera, not able to attend to any thing
around her. Luckily, Lady Saville, who
was engaged in a regular flirtation, observed
neither her preoccupation, nor
additional dejection; and when the curtain
fell, Emmeline mechanically followed
her companions out of the box.
Her complete absence of manner, and
Lady Saville’s exclusive attention to
him, who was whispering soft nothings
in her ear, had so effectually driven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>away all other visitors, that Emmeline
had no one to take charge of her; and
Lady Saville and her admirer soon parted
from her, the former having found a
friend to take her to the usual supper
party at Lady L——y’s after the opera;
and the latter being too gallant, and too
much <i>épris</i> not to accompany her to the
carriage, promising, however, to return
to Emmeline. At this minute, however,
Pelham, luckily observed her, and forcibly
making his way up to her, exclaimed,</p>

<p class='c013'>“What here! and alone! I thought
I saw strangers in your box, so never
went near it; how comes it I find you
in this desolate situation? Do take my
arm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline made no reply; and, soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>perceiving that she was more than usually
depressed, Pelham, after one two ineffectual
efforts, forbore even to speak
to her. They made their way towards
the door at the top of the great stairs;
and, leaving her there, Pelham went to
look for her carriage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline shrunk behind the door,
wrapping herself close up in her cloak,
and not daring to raise her eyes from
the ground for fear of meeting those of
her husband, or of Lady Florence. Her
own name, however, pronounced close
by her, soon roused her, and she saw
Mrs. Osterley coming up to speak to
her, accompanied by Mr. Moore.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dear Lady Fitzhenry,” said she,
“what an age it is since I have seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>you! Where have you been hiding
yourself? What can you have been
about?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have been out of town,” replied
Emmeline, in a faint voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes! I suppose at Easter, of
course; but surely you have been returned
some weeks; for I have frequently
met Lord Fitzhenry: and, by
the bye, now I recollect, I heard of you
the other evening, at Lady Mowbray’s,
where I was so unlucky, as just to miss
you; and I was sorry to hear you were
taken ill there: I hope you are quite
recovered.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perfectly so,” said Emmeline, coldly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How did you like our new opera, to-night?”
continued Mrs. Osterley. “I
thought it inexpressibly dull; yet, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Paris, I had liked it very much; what
did you think of it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I?” said Emmeline, absently, “I
really don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t know? I suppose you mean you
have been so agreeably engaged in conversation,
that you did not attend,” retorted
Mrs. Osterley, laughing. “No
one comes to the opera for the music in
London.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At that minute, Pelham relieved poor
Emmeline by saying, that her carriage
was driving up, and that they had better
be moving down stairs. She willingly
took his proffered arm, bowing to Mrs.
Osterley, who, before the door had closed
upon them, and within Emmeline’s
hearing, exclaimed, (with a loud laugh to
Mr. Moore,) “Well! that is the best arranged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>best understood affair I ever
saw. Lord Fitzhenry and his <i>chère amie</i>
are just gone down one stair, and Lady
Fitzhenry and Pelham are making their
escape by the other! and then we English
boast of our morality!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The door closing, prevented Emmeline
from hearing more than the burst of applause
which followed this remark. Involuntarily
she shrunk from Pelham;
but he, not aware of any thing that had
passed, intent on getting her to the
carriage as soon as possible, only pressed
her arm the closer, to steady her steps,
and hurried her almost forcibly after him.</p>

<p class='c013'>When they reached the bottom of the
stairs, they found an unusual crowd and
bustle among the servants; and, by the
noise and lashing of whips in the street,
there appeared to be great contention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>among the coachmen. Pelham, anxious
to get Emmeline out of the confusion, still
drew her on, persuaded that her carriage
must, by that time, be ready. But, when
they got outside into the street, he saw
that her coachman was engaged in violent
contest with another, both endeavouring
to drive up at the same moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>The crowd of footmen who had gathered
round the interesting spot, encouraging
the merciless combatants, was so great,
that to retreat was impossible. Pelham
could not, among them, distinguish Emmeline’s
servants; and, amid the din of
voices, whips, trampling of hoofs on the
pavement, and shivering of breaking
lamps, it was vain to attempt to make
them hear him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline, nervous and frightened at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the uproar around her, forgot for a minute
all her former apprehensions, and
clung terrified to Pelham; who, to defend
her as well as he could, from the unruly
mob, put his arm round her. Just
then, the horses in her carriage, high-bred,
spirited animals, and lately little
employed by their mistress, irritated
beyond endurance by the lashing of the
whip, became ungovernable; they reared
up, throwing themselves away from their
opponents, and, in the struggle, one of
them fell down on the foot-pavement,
increasing the confusion.</p>

<p class='c013'>A loud scream was uttered by a female
voice, and, by the rush of link-boys in an
instant to the spot, Emmeline beheld
Lady Florence Mostyn thrown back on
Fitzhenry’s breast. The pole of the carriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>had touched her, but it was the cry
of terror more than of pain.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stop! on peril of your life, you
rascal!” exclaimed a voice, that shot
through Emmeline’s very soul.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whose carriage is that?” demanded
Fitzhenry, in an authoritative tone, while
still supporting Lady Florence in his
arms. There was a sudden silence; the
contending coachmen’s whips instantly
were both quieted. He again repeated
his question more loudly than before.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My lord!” said one of Emmeline’s
footmen, going up to Fitzhenry, “it is
your lordship’s carriage.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>My</i> carriage!” he exclaimed angrily.
“Who ordered it here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are here with my lady,” replied
the terrified footman. “Her ladyship is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>just getting in—shall I tell her your lordship
wishes to be taken home?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no, you fool!” answered Fitzhenry,
in a tone of passion which Emmeline
had never before heard from his lips,
and which made her shudder; “drive off
as fast as you can.”</p>

<p class='c013'>By this time, Pelham had put his
charge, more dead than alive, into her
carriage, and, not liking to leave her
alone in the agitated state she then was,
got in after her. Emmeline put out her
feeble hand, meaning to prevent him;
but, quite overcome, she could not articulate
a word; and, no longer able to
command herself, she burst into violent
hysteric sobs. Totally mistaking her
meaning, and interpreting the action into
a wish that he should not leave her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Pelham tenderly seized her hand, desiring
the servants to go home as fast as
possible. The fallen horse was soon
raised. The contending vehicles disengaged,
and they drove rapidly off—but
followed by cheers and laughter from the
more blackguard part of the mob who
had witnessed the fray; to which were
added personal jokes and remarks, that
made Pelham hastily draw up the glasses.</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline still made efforts to speak
but Pelham could not distinguish a single
word which she endeavoured to articulate;
and, only bidding her compose herself,
said every thing most kind and
soothing, while he again and again
pressed her hand in his. When they
arrived in Grosvenor-street, he forcibly
drew Emmeline’s arm within his, to help
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>her up stairs, and, placing her on a couch,
demanded in a low voice, whether she
would take any thing, and whether he
should send for her maid.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh no, I shall soon recover—make
no fuss, I entreat—it is nothing—I have
been very foolish—and frightened—that
is all. But,” added she, with an imploring
look, “leave me—for God’s sake
leave me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not till I see you better, I really
cannot.” For her bosom still heaved
with convulsive sobs, and her heart
seemed bursting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Uncertain what to do, or say, and surprised
at her repulsive manner towards
him, Pelham walked, disturbed, up and
down the room in silence, thinking it best
for a little time to leave her to herself. At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>length, hastily coming up to her, “My
dearest Lady Fitzhenry!” he exclaimed,
“allow me to speak to you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline started, and looked at him
aghast; but without noticing, or even
looking at her, Pelham continued in a
hurried manner, “I trust you will pardon
me for venturing on so sacred a subject,—for
touching on sorrows, which you, with
such courage, such delicacy, conceal in
your own breast—but I know all;—and
I know your husband so well, that I am
sure I can give you comfort and hope.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Inexpressibly relieved as Emmeline
was by these words, which satisfied her
that she still had a friend on whom she
could rest, yet other feelings for the moment
prevailed, and clasping her hands
with the vehemence of despair: “Oh, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>is impossible! there is no hope, no happiness
for me in this world!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On my honour,” replied Pelham,
with earnestness, “you may trust me;
I would not deceive you;” and, sitting
down by her, he took her nervously
shaking hand in his. A few minutes
before, Emmeline would have shrunk
from his touch, but those words had
been sufficient to banish entirely all her
former miserable apprehensions; soothed
by hearing once more the consolatory
voice of friendship, for an instant she
smiled in gratitude on his kind countenance,
and then, quite overcome with
the variety of her feelings, tears again
burst forth, and her head sank on his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c013'>At that instant, the door was hastily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>pushed open, and Fitzhenry appeared!
He started on seeing Pelham and Emmeline.
As she quickly raised her
head at the noise he had made on entering,
involuntarily a faint exclamation of
dismay escaped her, and even Pelham
seemed disconcerted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Fitzhenry is not very well;”
the latter at length said, after an awkward
pause, as if feeling that some explanation
of the scene was necessary;
“and,” added he, addressing himself to
Emmeline, “allow me to recommend
you to retire to your own room.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline rose from her seat; every
limb shook. Fitzhenry came towards
them, fixed his eyes sternly upon her,
but said nothing. “I have not been
very well lately,” she with difficulty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>stammered out: “the heat in town does
not agree with me; and, I think, I will
go to Charlton to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Still Fitzhenry spake not, but Emmeline
plainly saw anger and contempt
written on his countenance: she faintly
wished him and Pelham good night. The
words died on her lips; for a sad foreboding
told her she was taking a final
leave of her husband, as she was aware
that it was impossible they could any
longer continue even on the footing they
then were. She paused a minute in
hopes Fitzhenry would speak. One
word would have brought her to his
arms, all forgiven, all forgotten. But he
seemed resolved on silence, and Emmeline
went on into the inner drawing-room
that led to her own apartment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pelham perplexed, and uncertain how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>to act, followed her with his eyes without
moving from the spot she had quitted,
while Fitzhenry, in great apparent perturbation,
paced the room. At length,
just as Emmeline had reached the door of
her own apartment, seeing her trembling
hands had some difficulty in opening it,
Pelham hurried to her assistance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You mean then,” said he in a low
voice, as he turned the lock, “to go to
Charlton to-morrow. You shall hear
from me, probably see me, and I will
bring you good news, perhaps even Fitzhenry;—cheer
up, I entreat you, all will
yet be well.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline forced a faint smile, and
held out her hand to him; he seized
it with affection. “God of heaven bless
and support you,” he said, with earnestness,
and hastily left her.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>When he returned to the outward
drawing-room, Fitzhenry was gone; he
hurried down stairs in hopes of finding
him in his own room, but the servants
informed him, he had again left the
house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline ordered her carriage after
church next morning, to take her to
Charlton; but how great a change do a
few hours often make in our views! She
already repented having declared her intention
of leaving town. Twice, as the
hour named by her drew near, she delayed
the carriage, wishing (much as she
dreaded the interview) to see Fitzhenry
before she went. It was now past three,
but still he did not appear, and no message
came from him. She rang the bell—“Is
Lord Fitzhenry gone out?” She
enquired, rather fearfully.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“No, my lady,” answered the footman;
“I believe my lord is not yet up;
at least he has not rung his bell; but
shall I enquire?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! no matter,” said Emmeline,
with a faltering voice, and dismissing
the man. Convinced by this, that it
was her husband’s intention they should
not meet, she determined to write to
him; for to part thus, in what seemed a
decided, open rupture, without some
sort of reconciliation taking place, she
now felt to be impossible: she therefore
sat down, and took her pen, although
not knowing what to say. She
once thought she would beg for an
interview—demand to be released from
her promise of silence, in order to come
to some explanation. But yet what had
she to say? what had she to learn?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Even if Mrs. Osterley’s strange and
cruel hints had reached his ears,—if he
could so mistake her and his friend, as
to give any credit to them, could she
flatter herself he was enough interested
about her, to care whom she might prefer?
On the other hand, to endeavour to
exculpate herself from suspicions which
he might never have entertained, seemed
ridiculous. Besides, could she now, as
a new thing, charge him with coldness,
dislike, and infidelity—all which he had
openly declared, and for all which he had
prepared her months before.</p>

<p class='c013'>Discouraged by these considerations
from adverting to what had passed the
night before, she at length, after various
doubts and indecisions, merely wrote
these words:—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span></div>
<div class='lh c009'>

<p class='c014'>“A very few days in the country will,
I am sure, quite restore me to my usual
health. I will return to Grosvenor
Street by the end of the week; but if,
for any reasons, you should wish me to
come home sooner, I trust to your letting
me know, and I shall be most willing
to obey your summons. You will
find me at my father’s.</p>

<div class='c015'>“<span class='sc'>Emmeline Fitzhenry.</span>”</div>

</div>

<p class='c016'>This she intended should be given to
Fitzhenry after her departure, and she
sealed and directed it for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c013'>The carriage drove up to the door—the
servants busied themselves in putting
on the luggage, and, hopeless of an
interview with Fitzhenry, Emmeline
went slowly, sadly, to her own room,
to prepare for her departure.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>On opening a drawer, she saw the
small Geneva watch and chain which
Fitzhenry had sent her when a girl.
Hardly aware of what she did, she
pressed it to her lips—then hung it round
her neck. She felt a sad presentiment
that she was leaving her husband’s roof for
ever, and this watch was the only token of
kindness she had ever received from him;
the only memorial she possessed, except
her fatal wedding-ring, placed by him on
her hand in reluctance and aversion.</p>

<p class='c013'>As Emmeline passed back through
the drawing-room, she looked mournfully
at each object in it, convinced she was
beholding them for the last time. She
slowly descended the stairs; every
limb trembling with nervous apprehension.
Again she thought she would endeavour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>to see her husband; and she
paused at the door of his room to give
herself one more chance; for she thought,
perhaps, when he heard her, he would
come out to meet her; or if she could
only once more catch the sound of his
voice, in its usual tone of gentleness and
kindness, it would give her courage to
demand admittance. But all was still.
While thus standing debating with herself,
her heart beat so violently, that she
could scarcely breathe, and she was
forced to lean against the banister for
support.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The chaise is quite ready, my
lady,” said a footman, coming up to
her; for, seeing her on the stairs, he
fancied her impatient to set off—“every
thing is put in.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>With no possible farther excuse for delay,
feeling her fate was fixed, she drew
down her veil, to conceal her agitation,
hurried through the hall, and without
allowing herself more time for reflection,
got into the carriage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To Charlton,” said the butler, who
had closed the door after her, the servants
being already placed in the seat
behind, and the postilions immediately
drove off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline looked back once more at
the house from which she felt she was,
probably, banishing herself for ever;
and then sinking back in the carriage,
gave way to her feelings. “Farewell,
then, Fitzhenry,” she exclaimed, “since
such is your will; and may heaven bless
you, and have pity on me!”</p>

<p class='c013'>As she drew near Charlton, she endeavoured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>to compose herself, but in
vain: when she looked to the future, all
was so dark and hopeless, and she was
so strongly impressed with the idea that
she should never see Fitzhenry again,
that she felt her heart sink within her;
and, quite overpowered, and fearful of
betraying her secret to her parents, she
more than once thought of stopping the
carriage. But whither could she go?</p>

<p class='c013'>Fitzhenry had allowed her to depart.
It seemed, indeed, even his wish that
she should go; and, unsolicited, she
could not return. On they drove. It
was a beautiful bright Sunday; every
one around her seemed to be enjoying
the day in gladness and gratitude. The
roads and fields were filled with joyous
groups, the air with gay sounds.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do I sin in loving him so entirely,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>so passionately?” thought Emmeline;
“that amid so many that rejoice, I alone
am doomed to be miserable?”</p>

<p class='c013'>In uttering these words, perhaps Emmeline
<i>did sin</i>. But it is the sin into
which suffering betrays us all. The
wretched are hidden, or hide themselves,
from our view; and when, in sorrow,
we look around us, we compare our
situation with those only who happen, at
that moment, to be basking in the transitory
sunshine of cheerfulness. How
many, as Emmeline’s gay equipage drove
rapidly by, probably coveted her riches,
her luxuries, her youth, and her beauty!
while she envied the ragged, laughing
beggar-boy, by the road-side, who, as
her carriage passed, tossed his naked
arms in the air, hallooing, in pure gaiety
of heart and enjoyment of existence.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>When</span> Emmeline arrived at her father’s,
the servant informed her, that both Mr.
and Mrs. Benson were out in the carriage,
but were expected home before
dinner. At that moment, she felt their
absence was a relief, and hastily getting
out of the carriage, she desired the coachman,
on his return to town, immediately to ask
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>whether Lord Fitzhenry had any orders
for him—for she still fondly hoped, that
on reading her note, he might follow her,
and might himself wish for some explanation
of what had passed the preceding
evening.</p>
<p class='c013'>During the hour that elapsed before
her father and mother returned, Emmeline
endeavoured to compose her spirits.
She bathed her red and swollen eyes,
walked in the fresh air, and, hearing their
carriage drive up to the door, resolved
to command herself, and went to meet
them with a cheerful countenance. But
when the spirits are weak, there is nothing
so difficult to bear as tenderness. Her
father’s fond benediction, the smile of delight
that beamed in her mother’s face,
on unexpectedly beholding her, were too
much for poor Emmeline, unused as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>was to demonstrations of affection; and
falling into her mother’s arms, in spite
of her resolutions and endeavours, she
again burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dear love! my child!” both exclaimed,
“what can be the matter?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing, nothing,” said Emmeline;
“I have not been quite well lately, and
my spirits are in consequence weakened;
and I was too happy to see you—that
is all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Benson shook her head, and
looked at her incredulously. Her father,
fixing his eyes stedfastly on her face,
took her hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Speak to me, my girl,” said he.
“What is it that so distresses you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing!” again repeated Emmeline
in a fainter voice; “I shall soon be
quite well.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“Emmy! Emmy!” rejoined her father,
“for once I don’t believe you; it is too
long since you have not been <i>well</i>, as you
call it; and there is <i>a</i> something the matter
that I must and will know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline averted her head, and did
not answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You need not attempt to deceive me
any longer, girl,” said Mr. Benson, sternly;
“I have long suspected that all was
not right between you and your husband.
I will now know the truth, and I have a
right to demand it of you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Still she was silent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What! you will not speak! you
will not confide in me!” he continued,
his temper rising; “then I must seek
for information elsewhere:” and he
moved towards the door of the room.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“Oh, my father!” exclaimed Emmeline,
terrified—“What would you do?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do? why I shall go to town directly.
I shall see Lord Fitzhenry,”
said Mr. Benson, in a calmer, but decided
tone; “and from him I must learn
what has passed between you, since
you, my own child, will not trust me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! speak not so to me, dear
father! indeed I have full confidence in
your kindness—in your indulgence; but
really, I have nothing to tell which you
do not know already—I have been to
blame, perhaps—I mean I was not
aware—I was deceived,—even you dear
father”—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Deceived?” repeated Mr. Benson
quickly—catching at the word: “deceived
by me? what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“Oh, nothing, nothing,” said Emmeline,
alarmed at her father’s unusual
look of anger: “we were all to blame,
but—but—perhaps it would have been
better if—”</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Mr. Benson, like many both of
his superiors and inferiors could not bear
to be supposed to have erred, or even
to have been mistaken, and all the less
when conscious the imputation was true;
in a tone of violence, therefore, which
Emmeline had never heard addressed to
her, and suddenly letting go her hand,
which he had been holding in both of
his: “What, Emmeline,” said he, “are
you so unjust, so ungrateful, as to accuse
me as the cause of your misfortunes?
blame your poor, doating, old
father for having given up his all to secure
your happiness? For shame, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>shame, Emmy, I never expected that
from you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh hear me, hear me patiently!”
she exclaimed, seizing on his arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, Emmeline, I can hear no more,
bear no more, I have long guessed how
matters were between you and Lord
Fitzhenry, and still I have forborne. I
held my peace as long as I could; but
my pride will not allow me to be any
longer silent. I will not be trampled
upon; I cannot endure to see the delight
of my old age, my only child, destroyed
by neglect and unkindness. Lord Fitzhenry
presumes upon his superior rank.
He thinks he may with impunity insult
and break the heart of the humble
banker’s daughter. But his lordship is
mistaken; I too have pride as well as he.
Curse on <i>his</i> rank, curse on <i>your</i> money;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>they have been the cause of all this; but
I will have redress.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Redress! Good God, what do you
mean?” enquired Emmeline, terrified at
his words and manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will insist on an immediate separation;
on a divorce, in short, for the
law will give it me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A scream of horror escaped from Emmeline’s
heart at these words. “No
power on earth shall ever separate me
from him,” she exclaimed, with the
wild energy of passion. “Oh! my dear
father, be appeased; have patience and
all will be well.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She had sunk on her knees, and,
overcome with the variety of her painfully
contending feelings, her head grew
giddy, her sobs choked her, and she
fell nearly senseless at Mr. Benson’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>feet. Every attention of doating fondness
was lavished upon her. Before
long, she became more composed, and
her parents, whose every feeling was
centered in her, seeing how weak she
was, both in body and spirits, said no
more, but turned their whole endeavours
towards cheering and restoring
her; avoiding, for the moment, every
thing that could renew her sorrows.</p>

<p class='c013'>After some little time had elapsed, as
if by common consent, they all forced
themselves to talk on indifferent subjects,
but, in the effort, poor Emmeline’s
lip often quivered. At dinner, she turned
away her heavy, sickened eye from the
food before her; and when her father
filled her glass with wine, bidding her
drink it, for that it would do her good,
and, assuming a gay manner, pledged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>her and drank to her health, tears
again rushed into her eyes, as she recollected
the pride with which he was
always wont on such occasions to unite
her husband’s name with hers.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next morning, resolving if possible
still to deceive her parents, and by assumed
cheerfulness to do away the impression
made upon their minds the preceding
evening, poor Emmeline entered
the breakfast-room with as composed a
countenance as she could command, and
even forced a smile, when, as in former
days, she went up to her father to claim
his parental kiss. Mr. Benson, however,
did not raise his eyes towards her,
or even return the pressure of her hand,
but in silence pointed to the seat prepared
for her. She looked at her mother,
whose eyes were fixed on the table before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>her, and she saw that they were red
with crying. Twice Emmeline endeavoured
at conversation by making some
remark on the weather, but no answer
was given to her. Mr. Benson’s attention
seemed entirely engrossed by the
newspaper that lay beside him, his
breakfast remaining untouched.</p>

<p class='c013'>Aware that something disagreeable
must have happened from the disturbed
appearance of her father and mother,
a thousand vague but dreadful apprehensions
soon took possession of Emmeline’s
mind, and at last, unable any longer to
endure the state of alarm and suspense
into which her fears had thrown her, she
suddenly seized her father’s arm, entreating
him for pity’s sake to tell her what
had so discomposed him, what had happened.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“You, Lady Fitzhenry, can better inform
<i>us</i> of that,” he coldly said, as he
put the paper into her hand, and pointed
to the following paragraph:</p>

<div class='lh c009'>

<p class='c014'>“A singular fracas took place at the
Opera on Saturday night; not being yet
informed of the particulars, we forbear
making any reflections. As it is a double
intrigue, and therefore neither party can
complain, it is impossible to say how the
affair may end. The <i>chère amie</i> of the
noble lord is well known in the fashionable
world both <i>abroad</i> and at <i>home</i>; and
it is not perhaps surprising that the neglected
wife should have <i>pris son parti</i>,
and found a champion to espouse her
cause. He is said to be in the <i>diplomatic</i>
line, and <i>of course</i> a particular friend of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the husband. One rumour states the
injured wife to have eloped—another
that a duel has taken place. Certain it
is that two carriages with the F—z—y
arms were seen to drive furiously out of
Grosvenor-street at different hours and
in different directions on Sunday afternoon.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>Emmeline turned deadly pale as she
read this cruel paragraph; but a still
more ghastly hue spread itself over her
mother’s face as she anxiously watched
her daughter’s countenance, and fancied
that in her emotion she read confession
of guilt.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a dead silence. Emmeline,
entirely satisfied as to her own perfect
innocence, and horror-stricken by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>latter part of the paragraph relating to
the duel, was occupied in dwelling on
the possibility of there being any foundation
for the rumour; and her whole mind
was so engrossed by that one thought,
the safety of Fitzhenry, that she did not
even think of exculpating herself from
the charge. Indeed, she had totally forgotten
the presence even of her parents,
when Mr. Benson, striking his hand with
violence on the table, in a voice of
agony exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Speak Emmeline, are you innocent?
or am I for ever disgraced?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline startled by her father’s vehemence,
looked wildly at him for an
instant, as if not understanding his
words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see, but too plainly, how it is.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Don’t speak, don’t speak,” he continued
quickly; and, covering his face with
both his hands, he gave way to the violence
of his feelings.</p>

<p class='c013'>Completely roused by the burst of
passion in one so seldom moved to tears,
Emmeline threw herself on her knees
beside him, and, endeavouring to take
hold of his hand, exclaimed,</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, my father, what can all this
mean? is it possible you can suspect?—God
knows how innocent I am.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Benson, wiping away his tears,
looked at her for an instant in silence.
“Repeat those blessed words again,
child, for I must believe you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By the God of truth!” exclaimed
Emmeline, as she clasped her hands
with fervency and fixed her eyes steadfastly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>on Mr. Benson, “I am innocent
of having, in thought, word, or deed,
departed from the love and duty, I
swore to my husband at the altar.
Alas!” added she, as she hid her face
in her father’s bosom, “I only love him
too well, too entirely for my happiness.”
These last words became indistinct, and
choked by her tears.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank God, thank God!” repeated
Mr. Benson, with a sort of hurried
nervousness of manner, as he kissed his
daughter’s forehead: “I could not have
borne that; your dishonour I could not
have borne, Emmy, it would soon have
brought me to my grave. I believe
you, Emmeline, on my honour I do;
you never in your life deceived me; but
what does that cursed story mean?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>pointing to the paragraph to which his
mind seemed again to have returned
with doubt and anxiety.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will tell you all, as far as——”
and Emmeline stopped short, for how
could she explain what had passed,
without drawing on a necessary confession
of her whole sad story.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No more concealments, Emmy, I
will and must know all,” said Mr. Benson
sternly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline looked at her father as if
supplicating for pity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Spare her now Mr. Benson,” said
her mother as she folded her in her
arms: “we have it from her own true
lips, that she is blameless, and let what
will have happened, we can bear any
thing now.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“Bless you, bless you for believing
me,” said Emmeline, as she threw her
arms round her mother’s neck in gratitude:
“but,” added she, with a melancholy
and reproachful look, “my father
does not, he still doubts me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, my girl, indeed I don’t,” cried
Mr. Benson: “do you think I would
call you my Emmy, and let you remain
one instant under my roof if I thought
you were disgraced. On my honour, I
believe you, but I am fretted and unhappy.
I have toiled for your happiness,
and it has ended in nothing but
mortification; for I see my darling is not
happy, which is more than I can bear,”
and tears once more rushed into his eyes.
“And who the deuce do they mean by
their ‘diplomatic champion?’” added he,
again casting his eyes on the paragraph.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“The whole is an abominable falsehood,”
said Emmeline, in a hurried manner.
“They mean Mr. Pelham, I suppose,
for he was with me;” and she reddened
as she spoke, at the bare possibility
of such an insinuation. “Coming
out of the opera-house last night, there
was a battle between the coachmen—and
it seemed as if something disagreeable
had passed between Lord
Fitzhenry and Mr. Pelham—but it
must have been only a misunderstanding—no
one was to blame—only when
I parted from them last night, they
certainly seemed much irritated against
each other.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And have you not seen your husband
since?” eagerly enquired Mrs. Benson.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said Emmeline, in a low tone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>and averting her head. Mr. Benson
gave a significant shrug of his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And pray what had you, and Mr.
Pelham, and Lord Fitzhenry to do with
the fighting of the coachmen; and, above
all, what in the name of wonder, had his
<i>chère amie</i>, as the idiots call her, to do
with it at all? whose carriage fought
with yours? for I presume, you and
your husband were together; surely you
can sit in the same coach, though you
can’t sleep in the same room?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I really can’t tell—it was all such a
confusion,” replied Emmeline, colouring
deeply. “But, dear father, don’t waste
time, but, for pity’s sake, send some one
to Grosvenor-street, and ask if all is
well—and yet, perhaps,” added she,
the next minute, alarmed at the possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>consequences of her own suggestion,
“perhaps it will be better not—it must
be all a foolish story.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall go myself to Lord Fitzhenry’s,”
said Mr. Benson, after a moment’s
reflection.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>You</i> go?” exclaimed Emmeline, terrified—“indeed
there is no necessity—it
is only a trifle—in fact nothing has
occurred, only the carriage——I assure
you, Lord Fitzhenry will be quite
surprised to see you—perhaps displeased—indeed
you had better not go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall judge for myself,” said Mr.
Benson, coldly. “I don’t believe one
word about the carriage story; your husband
would not be such a fool as to fight
about a scratched panel; and as for his
displeasure, I shall care little for that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>for he seems very little to care for
mine.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This intention of her father’s seriously
alarmed Emmeline; for, in the state of
irritation, in which both he and Lord
Fitzhenry then were, she dreaded the
result of their meeting; and, clinging to
Mr. Benson, she ejaculated—“Oh, then
pray let me go with you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Brought up in the good old fashioned
system of filial obedience and dependence,
Emmeline, although the object of
the tenderest affection, had no idea even
now that she was a wife, of putting her
will in opposition to that of her parents, or
of boldly declaring any determination of
her own. She could only entreat, and
<i>that</i> her countenance did most eloquently,
during the moment or two that now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>passed before Mr. Benson answered her.
At length, he consented, saying—“Yes;
I believe that will be best, for I shall
by that means hear both sides.”</p>

<p class='c013'>These words raised fresh apprehensions
in Emmeline’s mind, for she saw
that her father’s intention was to come
to some explanation with her husband;
and good, even kind as she knew those
intentions were, yet she felt, that any interference
on his part, particularly at that
moment, would only widen the breach
between them, and make her situation
worse, by bringing matters to that crisis
from which she shrank with dismay.
She, therefore, said every thing she
could venture upon, to induce him to
desist; but her words seemed only to
irritate him still more against Lord Fitzhenry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>and to make him the more resolved
on seeking an interview with him;
so at last, finding how vain were all her
arguments, and that having settled the
matter in his own mind, Mr. Benson
would listen to no excuse, no reason, that
she could give for changing her opinion
so quickly, Emmeline gave up the point
in despair, and, in a short time, she and
her father were on the road to town.</p>

<p class='c013'>At first, the miles appeared to her to
be endless, but, as they drew near town,
dreading the possible result of their
visit to Grosvenor-street, poor Emmeline
was several times tempted to beg the
driver might slacken his pace, but she
controlled her nervous agitation as well
as she could, and they drove on in silence,
till they entered London; when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>she suddenly seized Mr. Benson’s hand,
saying, with a look of entreaty—“If
we see him, you will leave all to me,—indeed,
he is no way to blame, only a
misunderstanding, which I shall soon be
able to clear up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay, and it <i>shall</i> be cleared up,” replied
Mr. Benson. “If you, Lady
Fitzhenry, are content to let this
vile slur remain on your reputation, I
am not, and I shall oblige those who
can refute it, to do so. I shall most
certainly see Lord Fitzhenry, and I must
from him get a better explanation of all
this strange business, than I can from you.
My God!” added he, after a moment’s
pause, as if speaking to himself—“to
think that my daughter’s name should appear
in a public paper, with such an imputation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>attached to it! to think, that
after all my labours, it should have come
to this!” And, after striking his cane several
times with impatience on the bottom
of the carriage, he suddenly, as if he
thought greater speed would relieve his
feelings, bade the coachman drive faster.</p>

<p class='c013'>This injunction was the means of soon
bringing them into Grosvenor-square;
and poor Emmeline’s agitation became
almost unbearable. What was
she going to learn? what was going
to be her fate? for on the next
hour she felt that it depended. They
drove up to the door of her husband’s
house—of her own home—and yet she
shrunk back, in dread and dismay. A
hasty glance showed her, that all the
shutters were closed—and a cold, deadly
sickness came over her. The servant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>knocked—but no one answered—he
knocked again, and rung; and at length
the porter appeared, and a parley ensued
between him and Mr. Benson’s servant.</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline could endure the suspense
no longer; and, with the paleness of
death on her face, grasping her father’s
arm—“In pity!” she cried, “speak to
the man yourself.” Mr. Benson beckoned
him to the carriage window.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I want to see Lord Fitzhenry,” said
he. “Is he at home?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir; neither my lord nor my
lady are at home”—for Emmeline had
so shrunk to the back of the carriage,
that the man did not see her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is Lord Fitzhenry quite well?” rejoined
Mr. Benson, not knowing very
well how to get at the information he
wanted.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“Yes, sir! I believe so,” said the
porter, apparently surprised at the
question. “His lordship went away
yesterday afternoon; he did not leave
his room till late, but I did not hear
that he was any ways ill; I thought
my lady had gone to Charlton.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you know where he is gone to?”
continued Mr. Benson.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I really can’t say; his
lordship ordered post horses in a
great hurry, and the carriage was to
take him up at some place in town,
but I really can’t tell where; but I
will enquire in the house if any one
knows.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did he leave word when he was to
return?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, my lord said nothing, and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>do not expect him back for some days,
as he gave no orders.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A new and appalling idea now flashed
across Emmeline’s mind—could Fitzhenry
and Lady Florence have fled together!
and, not content with the entire
possession of each other’s affections,
could they have determined by that open
act, at once to rid themselves of the
thraldom of their respective marriages!
There was nothing of which she could
not suspect Lady Florence; but her
heart smote her for thus, even for an instant,
accusing Fitzhenry; and, shocked
at her own surmises, she hastily enquired
whether Lord Fitzhenry had left
no letter, no message for her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not that I knows of, my lady,” said
the porter, bowing to Emmeline, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>evidently astonished at her question, as
well as at her appearance, as she had
hitherto remained concealed behind Mr.
Benson; “but I will go and enquire.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is all very strange,” muttered
Mr. Benson to himself, while he was gone;
“I can’t make it out for the life of me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As for poor Emmeline, she was totally
unable to express, or even to form an
opinion; so many fearful apprehensions
succeeded each other in her mind. After
an interval of time, which appeared to
her endless, the man returned with a
note in his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can hear of no letter, my lady;
but this note the housekeeper found in
your ladyship’s room; perhaps it is what
you mean.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline eagerly seized it; but what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>was her mortification on finding it was
her own note to Fitzhenry, with the seal
still unbroken. In the confusion of her
mind, she could not recollect whether, on
leaving home the preceding day, she
had given any orders about it: if she
had, she must conclude, that Fitzhenry,
occupied by other objects, had neglected,
perhaps scorned, to read it. But at all
events, as that note was unread, he must
have gone from home in the full conviction
that she, on her part, had left it in
open, declared war.</p>

<p class='c013'>Quite overcome by the combination of
distressing circumstances in which she
was placed, after tearing her ill-fated
note in a thousand pieces, with a vehemence
of impatience very foreign to her
nature, Emmeline again sunk back in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the carriage, to conceal her disordered
state from the servants. There was a
moment’s pause. At length Mr. Benson,
enquiring where Mr. Pelham lived,
desired the coachman to drive to his
house. Emmeline drew down the blind,
spoke not a word, but seemed to give
herself up to her fate in despair.</p>

<p class='c013'>When they reached the end of the
street to which they had been directed,
Mr. Benson stopped the carriage, and
saying he would return to her directly,
got out. He was some time absent:
when he returned, he evidently was endeavouring
to maintain a composure
which he did not feel.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Pelham has likewise left London,”
said he. “He too went away
yesterday evening with post horses——very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>strange; but, I suppose, some junket
out of town,” added he, making an awkward
attempt at cheerfulness. The step
of the carriage was let down for him.
“Hang me!” continued Mr. Benson,
“if I know what to do next, or where to
go to. To drive after them would really
be a wild-goose chase; for the chances
are a hundred to one against our taking
the same road; for the plague is, that
one don’t know at all where they are
gone to. Mr. Pelham’s servants, too,
can’t tell where their master went—a
parcel of stupid, outlandish boobies,
that can’t speak Christian-like language.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And apparently much distressed and
perplexed, Mr. Benson, with one foot on
the step of the carriage, looked anxiously
up and down the street, as if in the hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>of seeing some one, or something, that
could suggest an idea to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let us return to Charlton, directly,”
said Emmeline, in a low, broken voice;
for a new apprehension had entered her
mind. When she reflected on the gentle
nature of Pelham’s temper, on his devoted
affection for Fitzhenry, and adverted
to the falsehood of the newspaper story
in the part relating to herself, her
mind began to be much easier with regard
to the report of the duel. As to
Fitzhenry’s sudden departure from town,
it was certainly strange; and in spite of
her endeavours to combat the idea, she
could not help interpreting it in a way
the most agonizing to her feelings: but
still it was just possible that even there
she might be mistaken; and if so, nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>would be more likely to incense Fitzhenry
against her, or to widen the breach
between them, than finding she was following
his steps like a spy; and that
even Mr. Benson took upon himself to
enquire into his actions. The instant
this idea entered her mind, her whole
anxiety was to return to Charlton, and
there wait patiently till time explained
this alarming business; and a very few
hours must, she thought, relieve her at
least from suspense: she therefore again
entreated that they might go back to
Charlton immediately.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Benson paused for a minute or
two, as if ruminating in his own mind
on some method of obtaining information;
but none occurring, he, in a dejected
tone, bade the servants return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>home. The coachman turned his horses’
heads, and the father and daughter travelled
the nine weary miles back to
Charlton in total silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Benson, who had been anxiously
awaiting their return, soon saw she had
little good to learn; and forbore to
question Emmeline; but, after putting
into her hand a letter that had come for
her during her absence, went to learn
what had passed from Mr. Benson.</p>

<p class='c013'>The letter was from Mr. Pelham: it
contained these words, and was dated
Sunday evening.</p>

<div class='lh c009'>

<p class='c014'>“I cannot, as I had hoped and intended,
see you to-day, nor indeed to-morrow.
I find Fitzhenry has left town,
and I am about to follow him. Depend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>on me for doing all that friendship can
do, to restore him to you. So I still say,
‘be of good cheer.’ As soon as Fitzhenry
and I have met, I am sure I shall be
able to bring you good news. By Wednesday,
I think, you may depend on
seeing me; or, at all events, on hearing
from me; and I don’t despair of even
bringing Fitzhenry with me.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>This letter, meant to express comfort
and hope, conveyed the very reverse to
Emmeline’s sick mind; she had now no
doubt but that Fitzhenry and Lady Florence
had left town together, and that
if Pelham attempted at any remonstrance
or interference, however mild and sensible,
still every thing was to be feared
from his meeting with her husband
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>under such circumstances. That she
had parted with Fitzhenry for ever,
seemed now but too certain. There
was a mystery in Pelham’s letter that
evidently showed he had something to
conceal, and that could only be the most
dreadful of all intelligence to her. Poor
Emmeline raised her streaming eyes to
heaven, while she clasped her hands in
the energy of suffering, but not one
prayer could she utter. Alas! what had
she to ask? Could she wish again to
behold him who scorned, who loathed,
who had, in short, fled from her? And
could she wish to cease to love him?
What affectionate mind but recoils with
horror from the dreary thought? She
might, indeed, pray for release from an
existence which was become insupportable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>to her! And, perhaps, in the rebellion
of a young and suffering heart,
she did give utterance to the impatient
wish. But let mortals adore the Merciful
Power, who, pitying the weakness
of short-sighted humanity, marks not
down those prayers. It is the first pang
of severe suffering that wrings them
from us; in time, we learn to endure;
and, in the evening of a chequered life
we look back, perhaps, on those very
moments of sorrow with the greatest
gratitude, and say with the poet——</p>

<div class='lh c009'>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Amid my list of blessings infinite,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Stands this the foremost—that my heart has bled.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>The next morning the following paragraph,
which appeared in the newspaper,
seemed very much to relieve Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Benson; but, if possible, it only increased
Emmeline’s apprehensions.</p>

<div class='lh c009'>

<p class='c014'>“It is with sincere pleasure that we
can confidently contradict a report in
our last, respecting a certain noble pair
in Grosvenor-Street, in so far at least as
the fair fame of <i>one</i> of the ladies is concerned.
Lady F——y, we understand,
merely left town in order to pay a visit
to her father at Ch—l—n, where she
now is. A legal separation between the
parties may however be anticipated, as
it is certain that the noble Lord has also
most abruptly left home, and, it is whispered,
not <i>alone</i>. Rumour also states
that the diplomatic friend has followed
the fugitives, in order, if possible, to
prevent the scandal of a public eclat.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Mr. Benson’s feelings had been so entirely
engrossed by that part of the first
newspaper story, alluding to his daughter’s
supposed levity of conduct, and his
mind was so relieved by this public and
honourable acquittal, that he might have
overlooked the rest of the paragraph
just mentioned, had not Emmeline’s look
of misery reminded him, that though
that unfounded subject for distress was
removed, all her but too real causes for
anxiety remained.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tuesday passed without any intelligence
of any kind reaching them. Wednesday
at length arrived, and during its
heavy hours, the perturbation of Emmeline’s
agitated mind was painful to witness.
For on what Pelham was that
day to impart, she felt her future fate in
life depended.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>With one so young, and unused to
sorrow, hope still will linger, and even
though against her reason and her conviction,
the concluding words in Pelham’s
letter sometimes for an instant
caused a thrill of pleasure to her heart,
and she gave way to delightful anticipations.
Fitzhenry might have mistaken
<i>her</i> feelings towards him: she was aware
that latterly she had given way to irritation
in her manner. Pelham might
let him into the real state of her affections,
for she well knew that that friend
had read her heart right, and, perhaps,
when her husband knew all, his better
feelings would prevail, and would restore
him to her.</p>

<p class='c013'>But when Emmeline’s imagination
had carried her thus far, the chilling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>conviction of the truth came at once to
destroy these dreams of happiness, and
make place for despair. Thus, in all
the miserable agitation of doubt and
anxiety, she passed the day listening to
every sound, starting at the noise of
every bell, and the opening of every
door; and so wild were sometimes her
fantasies, that she more than once
thought she heard her husband’s step
on the stairs, and his voice in the passage
that led to her room. But the
day passed, and no one came.</p>

<p class='c013'>Late in the evening, when she had
nearly given up all hope, she heard the
door bell ring. She started up—every
pulse throbbed—unable to move from
her place, she remained breathless,
watching the door: it opened, but no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Fitzhenry appeared; and the servant
entering, brought her a letter. It was
not Fitzhenry’s hand-writing. A cold
tremor crept over her; the room swam
round her, and the letter fell from her
hands. Her mother caught it up, and
seeing how unable her daughter was
herself to read it, and dreading the effects
of such violent agitation on her
already weakened frame, she ventured
to break the seal, and hastily glancing
her eyes over its contents. “My child,”
said she, taking Emmeline’s icy hand,
“it is from your friend Mr. Pelham. He
says, he could not, as he meant, come to
you; that pressing public affairs oblige
him to return immediately to Vienna. He
is already on his way to Dover. Your
husband is quite well—but——”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“But what?” exclaimed Emmeline,
with a look of horror.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He too is gone abroad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gone!” repeated Emmeline wildly;
“then it is all over:” and she was carried
senseless to her bed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Her wretched parents wept and prayed
by her; for hers was a sorrow to
which no earthly comfort could be given.
In a few hours, however, composure—that
dreadful composure of exhausted
nature—returned, and the first minute
she could read, she asked for Mr. Pelham’s
letter. It contained these words:</p>

<div class='lh c009'>

<p class='c014'>“You will be surprised, and I fear
painfully so, when you hear we are
leaving England. Some unforeseen public
affairs oblige me instantly to return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>to the Continent; and, I am going to
take Fitzhenry with me: but, for God’s
sake, keep up your spirits; he is well,
and we have had a great deal of conversation.
In time, you shall know all;
and very soon, I am sure, he will be
restored to you; but my poor friend’s
mind is at present in a state approaching
to delirium; and we must be patient
with him.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Dearest Lady Fitzhenry, I would
not for the world give you false hopes;
but, I still repeat, that all will be well;
you deserve to be happy, and heaven
will take care that you shall be so.
Fitzhenry has been infatuated, blinded,
deceived, every way. But his eyes are
now opened, and, (not for the world would
I deceive you, even to give you one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>moment of false happiness,) trust me,
he admires and loves you; I was certain
such excellence could not long be
thrown away upon one so fitted to appreciate
it. The fatal madness which has
hitherto rendered him insensible to his
real happiness, is now at an end—on my
honour it is.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I have time for no more; the carriage
is at the door; I am only waiting
for Fitzhenry; he knows I am writing
to you; you shall ere long hear from me
again.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>Emmeline hardly knew what to conclude
from this letter; she read it over
and over. Sometimes she interpreted
its contents favourably to her feelings;
but, in general, the impression it left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>was not that of hope. She believed
Pelham, when he told her that Fitzhenry’s
connexion with Lady Florence
was at an end; she must believe such
solemn assurances; but what had she
gained? Her rival, no longer the cause,
still her husband fled from her. What
could that mean, but that still she had to
encounter settled, determined aversion?
for he was leaving England without one
word, one attempt at reconciliation—and
with no time even named for his
return. In short, in spite of Pelham’s
encouragement, she felt but too well
convinced their separation was for ever.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sorrow sunk deeply into Emmeline’s
heart; but, for her parent’s sake, she
resolved to exert herself. She left her
room, agreed to go out into the fresh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>air; acquiesced in whatever was proposed
to her; forced herself to converse
on indifferent subjects; and even sometimes
endeavoured at cheerfulness. But
such exertions could not deceive. The
“sickness of hope deferred,” preyed on
her health; she grew daily thinner;
and her cheeks were either deadly pale,
or flushed with the deepest feverish
crimson.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Mrs. Benson gazed at her in
silent anxiety. There was their Emmeline
again returned to them, to the same
place, the same quiet home, avocations
and duties she used to perform; but,
how changed! Formerly, she was their
joy, their pride: to look on her laughing
eyes, and on her fresh smooth cheek,
had been enough to make them happy;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>but now the sight was misery. Mr. Benson
also was changed. Though sometimes,
in the kind endeavour to cheer his
melancholy companions, he attempted to
resume his usual loquacity, and even
tried his bad jokes; yet, as they no longer
proceeded from an exuberantly happy
heart, they had lost their only merit;
and, seeing how ill they in general succeeded,
and that his intended wit and
mirth oftener forced tears than smiles
from his suffering daughter, he at last gave
up the attempt entirely, and seemed to
resign himself to the sadness which oppressed
him. He appeared also to have
entirely lost his usual bustling activity.
He often stood for hours at the window,
with his hands in his pockets, staring at
the blue sky and green grass, objects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>which he had never been seen to gaze
at before; or, sitting with the newspaper
in his hand, reading over and over
the same page, almost unconscious of
the words before him; for now, neither
public news, nor even the price of stocks,
seemed to have power to arrest his
attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fitzhenry was never named among
them, nor that painful subject any way
alluded to.</p>

<p class='c013'>One day, however, that Mr. Benson
and Emmeline were alone together, after
the former had, as was now usual to
him, sat a long time silent, he suddenly
looked up, and, addressing her in the
decided tone of one who has well considered
the matter of which he is about
to treat—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“Emmy!” said he—for he had now
quite left off calling her Lady Fitzhenry,
which he had, with apparently proud
satisfaction after her marriage, always
done—“Emmy, I have indulged your
fancies all this time—I have complied
with your request—I have said nothing—done
nothing. In short, to please you,
I have, in truth, made but a silly figure;
but this cannot go on—it is impossible—you
cannot yourself wish it. Something
decided must be settled between you
and your husband.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline’s pale cheek grew still paler,
and, in answer, she put into her father’s
hand Mr. Pelham’s last letter. He read
it over and over and over several times,
looked at the date, the signature, the
direction, even with the precaution and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>accuracy of business, and then returning
it—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can’t make head or tail of it.
Lord Fitzhenry and you, Emmy, and
your diplomatic champion, are all beyond
my comprehension. I declare I
don’t know what any of you would be at.
If your husband has turned off his kept
mistress, as I suppose he has by this,
(shame on him ever to have had one—and
another man’s wife, too, into the
bargain,) why, now the coast is clear,
why can’t he come and fetch you, his
lawful wife, home, and live respectably,
and be at least decently civil to you.
What the deuce is he gone abroad for?
unless indeed it is to look out for some
new lady, being, I suppose, tired of the
old one—for such madams, I believe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>abound at Paris. In short, Emmy, I will
not let this sort of thing go on any longer.
I will give you one month; and if during
that time, your husband makes no advances
towards a reconciliation, I will
then come forward. Surely, Emmeline,
your own pride must make you wish
that I should.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pride!” repeated Emmeline, mournfully.
“Oh! my father, what has pride
to do with affection?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What!” rejoined her father, warmly,
“can you tamely submit to be insulted
and neglected as you are? And pray
what has affection to do with the business?
when this man don’t seem to
care one farthing for you; and, now
indeed that the truth comes out, it
seems he never did. A pretty object for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>affection truly. I thought you had better
feelings. Fool! idiot! that I was,” continued
he, striking his forehead, “to be
so proud of this marriage. Could I have
guessed how matters would have turned
out, I had rather have seen you the wife
of the lowest clerk in my banking-house,
than that of this Lord Fitzhenry, or any
other lord in Christendom with his vile
paramour. But who would have thought
it of him? such a fine young man as he
was. I always liked the lad; there was
something so frank and manly about him.
Do you remember those balls we used to
give on your birth-day, Emmy, when he
always danced with you, as a thing of
course? How you used to tear about the
room together like a couple of madcaps,
looking so happy! Then, when he took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>leave of you going abroad—Lord, I remember
it as if it was but yesterday—he
kissed you and called you his little wife.
My silly heart jumped with joy at those
words. And then he sent you that watch
which I see still hanging round your
neck. I thought all that promised so
well. Who could have dreamt of his
turning out as he has done? And even
since your marriage at Arlingford, how
civil and pleasant he was to me, and to
you even seemingly. I really can hardly
now bring myself to believe any one so
young can be so deceitful and hardened!”</p>

<p class='c013'>How long Mr. Benson might have gone
on thus giving vent to the thoughts which
apparently now constantly engrossed his
mind, it is impossible to say; for, kind-hearted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>and affectionate as he was, he
had so little notion of the nature of
love, of the refinement of poor Emmeline’s
passion, and of the feelings of a
lacerated heart that recoils from every
touch, that he had no idea he was running
daggers into hers; till, no longer
able to endure the torture of his words,
and grasping his arm in agony, “Oh, my
father!” she exclaimed, “do not talk of
him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, well,” said he, patting her
hand as he looked with concern on her
suffering countenance, “if it displeases
you, we need not talk of the matter just
now; but remember, Emmy, one month
more, and I <i>will</i> have my own way in
this business.”</p>

crossed the water to Calais; but she
heard no more. This strange silence
seemed to confirm her husband’s hostile

fix her future fate. She uttered no complaint,

resigned, and appeared to be some figure
wound up to perform the ordinary actions
of life without taking any part in them,
so still was her composure. But sometimes,
when her mother looked at her,
pressed her hand, or kissed her pale
cheek, then, a momentary convulsive sob
would escape from her oppressed bosom,
and a solitary burning tear would steal
down her face.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a dead pause in affliction
which is dreadful. As long as we have
to act, to exert ourselves, even though
those exertions may be painful, still they
are more bearable than sitting down
quietly with grief, without any thing to
look to. When day after day passes the
same, and when at last from the sameness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>of our thoughts and feelings, even
suffering has no longer power to affect
us, our tears cease to flow, though the
heart within is breaking.</p>

<p class='c013'>The dreary desolation of her future
existence, from which, appalled at the
prospect, she at first shrunk with horror,
now constantly occupied her, to the exclusion
of every other thought, and of
every ray of hope. A short twelve-month
back, knowing no felicity beyond
loving, and being beloved by her
fond parents, she was at peace, and
happy—now, new feelings, new powers
of heart, unknown to herself before,
had been awakened in her, and she
hated herself when she felt—(and she
could not help feeling it) that not all
their kindness, all their partial affection,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>could soothe and occupy a heart
which <i>love</i>, love for Fitzhenry had now
so entirely engrossed. Love is a draught
of so inebriating a quality, that it is
long before one who has known its
delirious power can (even when that delirium
ceases) return satisfied to the sober
feelings of friendship. The sun which
had warmed and illumined life is set;
and all other near and dear affections,
are as the quiet cold rays of moonlight
to the bereaved soul which shivers beneath
their chilling influence.</p>

<p class='c013'>How often when endeavouring to
soothe those who are writhing under
such sorrows, are the affections of parent
and kindred offered as compensations.
But such comfort, sickening
the heart at its own ingratitude, only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>adds to its misery. Time alone, the
sobering influence of years, can heal
such wounds, or rather skin them over,
for the scar remains, till at last it thickens
and hardens, rendering it insensible
to every impression; but is that happiness?
When a sacred voice announced,
that “a man shall leave father and mother,
and cleave to his wife”—it plainly
told how overwhelming such feelings
were intended to be; and if allowed,
nay, commanded in man, how much
more in woman, whose existence is
made up of the affections of the
heart!</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Emmeline endeavoured to resume
her usual occupations, but in vain.
She tried to read—it was impossible;
once or twice, in the wish to pass the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>heavy hours, she proposed reading aloud
to her mother, as she had formerly done.
Her lips mechanically uttered the words;
but, at a pause, Mrs. Benson making
some remark on the book, Emmeline
startled at the sound of her voice—looked
vacantly at her, apparently unconscious
of what she alluded to. The
mother, suppressing a sigh, endeavoured
at some explanation, but seeing how
hopeless was the attempt to fix her
daughter’s mind on any subject, she
quietly closed the book, saying, “Emmy,
my love, we will continue that
some other time, for I think reading
hurts your eyes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline gave her a meanless, melancholy
smile in answer, and sat in silence;
her eyes fixed on the volume,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>as if even unconscious that their lecture
was over. Lost as she was in thought,
it would perhaps have been difficult for
her to have told what those thoughts
were, all was so vague; and on no one
circumstance in her situation, could she
rest her mind with expectation of any
sort. Even religion could bring her little
comfort. Had Fitzhenry, penitent
towards heaven and herself, been taken
from her by death, she would have found
peace for her thoughts in piety. She could
have said to her widowed heart—we shall
meet again. But that way, Emmeline,
shuddering, dared not look. Often too,
she aggravated her distress by reproaching
herself for having brought sorrow
and melancholy to that home, which
had been always hitherto one of content
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>and cheerfulness; and she sometimes
thought it was her duty to leave it, and
relieve her parents of her painful presence—but
whither could she go? was
Arlingford still her home? could she venture
to return there?</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus, day after day sadly passed
without her being able to form any
plan for herself or the future, till she
was one morning roused from the state
of stupor into which she had sunk, by
Lord Arlingford being suddenly announced.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since the marriage, for which both
he and Mr. Benson had been so equally
anxious, there had been little intercourse
between them. Lord Arlingford having
obtained his object, and secured Emmeline’s
fortune, he was not particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>anxious to keep up any thing like intimacy
with Mr. Benson, whose honest,
blunt vulgarity, did not at all suit the
refined elegance of his own manners and
habits.</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline was with her mother alone
when Lord Arlingford entered. She
turned deadly pale; for, in a minute, a
thousand apprehensions as to the possible
purport of his visit occurred to her;
and, hardly knowing in what manner to
meet him, she remained in her place, with
the feelings of a criminal awaiting the
sentence of his judge. But such alarming
fears were soon dissipated—his manner
was more than usually kind—she was
his “dear Emmeline, his pretty daughter.”
He quite overcame Mrs. Benson
with civilities, and was so very particular
and anxious in his enquiries after Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Benson, and whether he could not have
the pleasure of seeing him, that at last
Emmeline thought it best to go and
inform her father of his visit, hoping
that Lord Arlingford’s conciliatory manner
might pacify his justly indignant
feelings. When she told him who
was in the drawing-room with her mother,——</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it—I know it quite well
child,” said he, impatiently; “you
need not have come for me; why did
you not say I was out, or busy, or sick?
I am sure you may say the last with
truth, for I am not half the man I used
to be. I don’t want to see him; he is
only come to try and palaver me over;
and if I do go down to him, what in the
world can we say to each other? Your
marriage is the only thing we have talked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>about these last ten years, and the less
now said of that the better, I am sure:
and I am sore here,” said the good old
citizen, seizing on his waistcoat, and
rubbing it across his breast; “and I don’t
want him to make matters worse. I wish
his lordship had staid at home; for what
the deuce can he be come here for?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“For no unkind purpose, I am sure,”
said Emmeline, wishing to pacify her
father—“for his manner to me is more
than usually affectionate. For my sake,
dear father, come down to him, and be
cordial to him,” said she, grasping his
hand with fervency, while her imploring
eyes, fixed on his face, spoke all the
feelings of heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are a silly girl, Emmy,” said
her father: “you have no proper pride.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>This abominable husband of yours has
made a perfect fool of you; but go away
to the drawing-room; say I will be down
directly. Plague on him, he has turned
me quite topsy-turvy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline returned to Lord Arlingford,
and was happy to find him and her mother
conversing on indifferent subjects.
In nervous agitation, she seated herself
by them, listening with painful anxiety
for her father’s approach—while her eyes
and ears were fixed on Lord Arlingford,
eagerly watching for every look, every
tone, that bore the slightest resemblance
to his son. It is hard to say, whether
there is most pain or pleasure in such recollections
of a beloved object, but who
can help catching at them? A glance, a
word will sometimes make the heart start
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>from a stupor of grief to which it had
been reduced, and give it a passing sensation
of something we, at the moment,
mistake for happiness. So it was with
Emmeline; and, lost in such thoughts,
she sat gazing on the still handsome
countenance of Lord Arlingford, till,
hearing her father’s step, she hastily
rose, and walked towards the window,
to conceal her nervous apprehensions as
to the result of their meeting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Benson entered the room with a
knit brow and both hands in his pockets;
but Lord Arlingford’s decided resolution
to meet him cordially, at last forced one
hand out of its repulsive retreat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am glad to find our Emmeline
looking better than I expected,” said
Lord Arlingford, a little at a loss for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>subject to begin with—the coldness of
Mr. Benson’s look and manner having
rather disconcerted him. “I heard she
had left town on account of her health,
the heat having been too much for her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know what your lordship
expected,” said Mr. Benson, surlily,
“but Lady Fitzhenry can scarcely look
worse than she does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Arlingford not seeming to heed
the incivility of his answer, continued—“Ernest,
too, did well to leave London,
for he knocked himself up in the House
of Commons. No constitution can stand
it; and I was quite glad when I heard
he had obtained <i>leave</i> of <i>absence</i> to take
a little trip on the continent, with his
friend Mr. Pelham,”—and Lord Arlingford
glanced at Emmeline, with a look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>which meant to express gallant pleasantry,
but the anxiety which accompanied
it, was very perceptible.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Benson cleared his throat—seemed
beating the time of some tune
on his knee, and, after a moment’s pause,
said: “In my time, husbands and wives
took those little trips together; but I
presume that is no longer the fashion;
at least, not at the west end of the
town.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Arlingford made no reply—but,
turning to Emmeline—“I suppose you
can hardly have heard from our travellers
yet; that lazy boy, Ernest, has not
written to me one word since he went.
Indeed, it was the newspapers that first
informed me of his departure; but, in
truth, I believe the wind has been directly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>contrary for packets coming over. I never
remember, at this time of the year, such
a continuation of high winds; and those
diplomatic people always travel <i>ventre à
terre</i>, in order, I suppose, to give a vast
opinion of their importance; so we must
not be too severe on Fitzhenry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline tried to speak; her nervous
lips moved, but not a word could she articulate;
and her mother, wishing to
change the subject, made some remarks
on the freshness and beauty of the
country.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, indeed it is particularly beautiful
just now,” said Arlingford; “and I
do wonder how people can remain in town
as they do; however, numbers have followed
our wise example, and I thought
the streets looked very dull and empty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>to-day, as I passed through. I suppose,
Lady Fitzhenry, you have no thoughts
of returning to Grosvenor-Street, while
Ernest is away. I dare say he would
not trust you in the gay world of London
without him,” added he laughing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline, without raising her eyes
from the carpet, on which they had been
fixed, replied, that she meant to remain
at Charlton some time longer.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a dead pause. Poor Mrs.
Benson was painfully occupied in observing
her daughter; and Mr. Benson seemed
resolved on avoiding every thing like
advances to his visitor, who, at last, was
again forced to start a new subject.
Taking, therefore, a desperate resolution
to come at once to the point, and ascertain
how matters were likely to be between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>him and the Benson family, or
rather, between his son and daughter-in-law,
he said, “the principal object
of my visit to-day, was to try and
persuade you all three to come and
pay me a visit at Wimbledon. I am
now quite alone, and it would really be
a charity”—and he addressed himself
particularly to Mr. Benson.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know I am a man of business,
my lord,” said he dryly—“my time is
little at my own disposal. I cannot at
present absent myself from home; and
as for Emmeline, I do not think she is
just now in a state to make any visits.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, coming to me,” rejoined Lord
Arlingford, with most determined civility
and good humour, “would only be exchanging
one home for another. My
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>dear Emmeline, will you not indulge
me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline made some answer, but her
words were unintelligible. She saw,
every minute, that Mr. Benson’s temper
was rising, and she shook from head to
foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, you will think of it, and let
me know when you feel inclined to
come,” said Lord Arlingford, seeing it
was useless to endeavour to press the
matter any further—“and, perhaps, if
we put it off a little, Mr. and Mrs. Benson
will be able to accompany you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Benson made no answer; he had
left his seat, and was restlessly fidgeting
about the room. “So it shall remain
that you write to me, and name your
own day,” added Lord Arlingford, rising.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“Yes, your lordship will shortly hear
from me,” said Mr. Benson, with a
meaning, in his tone and manner, that
Emmeline understood but too well; and,
unasked, he rung the bell.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, God bless you, my fair Emmeline,”
said Lord Arlingford, kissing her
on both cheeks, with a sort of flirting
gallantry of manner that was so habitual
to him, that neither age nor the infirmities
of sickness had altered it, and which
he maintained even with his daughter-in-law.
“Make haste and recover the
roses which, I must confess, the dissipation
of London has a little <i>flétri</i>, that
Ernest may find you in bloom and beauty
on his return; and we must mutually let
each other know when we hear from
him; I am the most interested in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>bargain, as I think we can guess who
will have the first intelligence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again Lord Arlingford forced Mr. Benson’s
reluctant hand into his, and overcoming
Mrs. Benson with civil speeches,
went to his carriage. Mr. Benson constrained
himself so far as to accompany
his visitor to the hall-door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“By the bye, my dear Benson,” said
Lord Arlingford, stepping back just as
he was entering the carriage, “when
you do come, you shall find my horses
to meet you in London, for it is too far
to come the whole way with your own,
and mine have positively nothing to do,
so that it will be a kindness to give them
a little exercise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your lordship is very kind,” said the
banker, with an expression of irony, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>ill concealed, offended pride on his countenance,
“<i>whenever</i> I do visit you, I will
certainly claim your obliging offer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>After Lord Arlingford had driven off,
all remained for some time silent; at
length Mr. Benson muttered to himself,
“I see through it all—I am not the fool
he takes me for—I am not to be coaxed by
a few civil speeches from a lord into mean
forbearance. A fortnight more, and I
shall most assuredly visit his lordship,
and he shall see whom he has to deal
with. <i>You</i>, Emmeline, I dare say, would
wish to go and curry favour with him,
that he may speak a word in your favour
to his precious son, and you may, if you
please; but I’ll be d—d if I do, till it is
to tell him a bit of my mind, and inform
him, in pretty plain terms, that you and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>your husband are two, and that the law
will give us redress.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And so saying, Mr. Benson left the
room more irritated in temper than Emmeline
had ever seen him. Her head
fell on her hands, and her long-stifled
feelings burst forth.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bear up, dearest Emmy,” said her
mother, endeavouring to soothe her;
“surely this visit of Lord Arlingford’s
must, in many ways, give you comfort.
He never would have come unless he
had known that all was likely soon to be
explained, and to end well between you
and your husband.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline shook her head. “You
don’t know them as I do. No two beings
can be so different, can act on such different
motives, as Lord Arlingford and——Fitzhenry.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>At that name, that
beloved name, for the first time for long
uttered by herself, she sobbed as if her
heart would break. “And then my father,”
she continued, “he terrifies me.
Oh! that he could, that he would for
my sake, be more patient, more conciliatory!
He talks, too, always of pride,
and forgets that one can have none where
one loves as I do. Oh! if I could but
see <i>him</i> once again!” she exclaimed,
clasping her hands, “I believe I could
on my knees entreat of him to be kind
to me, to love me—I am so very miserable;
and yet when I was with him, when
I saw him every day, I was cold and
repulsive, I know I was; I believe I was
the most to blame. I dare say I could
have won upon his kindness had I acted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>differently; for he is so kind to every
body, every thing—but me. It must
have been all my fault.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus did poor Emmeline comfort herself
by voluntary self-accusation, rather than
impute blame to him she worshipped.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the agitation occasioned by Lord
Arlingford’s visit had subsided, the family-party
at Charlton returned to their former
melancholy composure. Day after day
still passed, and no letter came; no intelligence
reached them. Every ray of
hope now vanished; all intercourse between
Emmeline and the being on whom
her existence hung, seemed now at an
end for ever. Her father never alluded
to the subject; but she had every reason
to think that he still kept to his resolution
of demanding an explanation; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>indeed their formal and total separation
seemed now almost unavoidable. Even
Pelham, her best friend, seemed to have
forgotten her; and thus deserted, the
few past months of her life, during which
all the feelings of her heart had been
roused, and a new existence had been
opened to her, seemed a dream of delirium.
All had vanished. Apparently
also neglected by that gay world which
so lately courted her with all its most
intoxicating blandishments, the admired,
flattered Lady Fitzhenry, had again sunk
into Emmeline Benson, and was living
in all the retired concealment of guilt,
without one fault, one folly to be laid to
her charge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps some of her fashionable friends
when they chanced to drive through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Grosvenor-street, and when their attention
was attracted by the closed windows
of Lord Fitzhenry’s house, at that season
of the year when every open London
balcony is gay with dear-bought sooty
flowers, might, as they cast up their eyes
on the deserted habitation, wonder what
had become of its inmates, and what
might be the most like truth of the many
stories which were for some days circulated
about them.</p>

<p class='c013'>But after those few days, the daily
business of amusement, and some new
tale of scandal, soon superseded that of
the Fitzhenrys; their vacated places were
soon filled up at those meetings of pleasure
to which they had been invited;
and <i>he</i> was allowed quietly to prosecute
his journey on the Continent, and <i>she</i> to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>drag on her melancholy existence within
nine miles of all her former associates,
unmolested and unthought of. Who then
would sacrifice happiness or comfort to
the opinion of the world? Often the
sacrifice of a whole life to the idle talk
of a day!</p>

<p class='c013'>One evening, when the Benson family
were as usual sitting together in mournful
silence, which was only at times
broken by some forced remark from Mrs.
Benson, as she sat dismally at her work,
her husband having had recourse to his
usual amusement, the newspapers, the
latter looking suddenly towards Emmeline,
said: “At last I see the abominable
west wind has changed, and has allowed
vessels to get across the Channel: no
less than four French mails are due.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Emmy, dear girl, cheer up,” added he,
patting her cheek as he spoke; “there
is no saying what news these mails may
bring, for I dreamt last night——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Benson was here interrupted in
his intended story by a loud ringing at
the door-bell; he started up and hurried
out of the room. No one spoke, but all
had the same idea—all fancied it could
only be Lord Fitzhenry. Mrs. Benson
laid down her work, and moved towards
the hall. Emmeline alone sat immoveable.
Her father was at the house-door,
and opened it before any servant could
reach it. She heard the trampling of
a horse on the threshold—heard a voice
in brief communication with him. A
footstep approached the room—she fixed
her eyes wildly on the door, scarcely able
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>to breathe. But again she had to endure
the torture of disappointment—Mr. Benson
entered alone, with a letter in his
hand, brought, he said, by a man on
horseback, who had orders to deliver it
with all speed. The letter was for Emmeline,
and the direction was in Pelham’s
hand-writing. She hastily broke the
seal, and while every pulse in her heart
and in her head throbbed, she read
these words:</p>

<div class='lh c009'>

<p class='c014'>“You would have heard from us before,
but Fitzhenry has been ill—indeed
is so still. We are here at Paris delayed
on our journey. If you could, (I need
hardly add, if you would,) I should wish
you to set off immediately, on receiving
this, to join us. Trust me, I would urge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>nothing that I was not certain was for
your and your husband’s <i>mutual</i> good.
At Dover you will find a vessel ready to
bring you over, and my own courier to
accompany you, who will prevent all
delays and difficulties. Lose no time.
Fitzhenry has had a most violent and
alarming fever; but to-day, I think, there
is some decided amendment—the medical
people now are sanguine. God
bless you.</p>

<div class='c015'>“<span class='sc'>G. Pelham.</span>”</div>

</div>

<p class='c016'>Emmeline held out the letter to her
father, while her full heart relieved itself
by tears; when he had read it, without
looking at her, he said: “Well, how do
you mean to act?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>“How!” said Emmeline, breathless
with agitation, “why set off directly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know that I shall agree to
that,” answered Mr. Benson, with the
same forced <i>sang froid</i>. “In this business
you are not fit to judge for yourself,
and I must consider for you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline grasped her father’s arm,
endeavouring to catch his averted eyes:
“Dear father! I think you have never
yet had reason to doubt my obedience
to your will, so you must now forgive
me for saying, that no power on earth
shall prevent my going to my husband.
My only chance for happiness in this
world, duty, every thing, in short, calls
me to him. Do not, I entreat, forbid me,
for I could not obey you.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“But,” rejoined Mr. Benson, rather
impatiently, “it is not your husband that
sends for you. Mr. Pelham does not even
say that he knows of his writing to you;
and I am sure he would make the very
best of the matter, for he seems to be a
kind, friendly sort of man.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed he is,” answered Emmeline;
“and indeed I can trust to him. He
would not have written for me had he
not been sure it was <i>his</i> wish. Dearest
father, I must, I will set off directly;
and do not let me go with the pain of
your displeasure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Benson joined her arguments to
Emmeline’s entreaties, bringing in, with
excusable artifice, something about the
duty and devotion of a wife, till, at last,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Mr. Benson seemed somewhat moved;
and a glance which he caught of Emmeline’s
face, crimsoned with agitation and
animated with painful anxiety, completely
overcoming his intended firmness,
he opened his arms to his trembling
daughter: “Well, well, you women always
get the better, always make fools
of us men. The truth is, I am heartily
tired of your dismal face, Emmy, and of
all this weeping and wailing—that is the
truth of it; so e’en take your own way,
so that we may be all happy again. But
I can tell you, positively you shall not
go alone, child; at all events, I <i>will</i> go
with you to Dover.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But directly, dear father—no delay—the
happiness or misery of my life may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>depend on an hour—now, this very
night, let me set off.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! as for that, I am always for
dispatch, you know. If a thing is to be
done, let it be done directly, that is my
saying. There is no fear of John Benson
dawdling.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And the good-hearted old man, rubbing
his hands, hurried out of the room
to give the necessary orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>In an instant, all was bustle in the
house. Mr. Benson himself paced away
to the stables to hasten the harnessing
of the horses; and Emmeline, a few
minutes before inanimate and almost lifeless,
now, with a flushed cheek, restlessly
paced the hall and drawing-room,
impatient at every moment’s delay. She
hardly knew whether she had most cause
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>for dread or hope from the contents of
Mr. Pelham’s letter. Fitzhenry was ill—plainly
very ill; and, as her father
said, it was not even hinted that it was
by his desire she had been summoned;
but still she thought she could trust to
that kind, considerate friend; and the
idea, the delightful idea, that in a few
days she would again behold Fitzhenry,
got the better of every other
thought.</p>

<p class='c013'>While Emmeline was thus counting
every second till the carriage came to
the door, Mrs. Benson busied herself in
those necessary preparations for the journey,
which her pre-occupied daughter
never thought of. At last, by midnight,
all was ready; and followed by the
blessings and good wishes of her mother,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Emmeline set off with her father for
Dover.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall come back to you, perhaps,
the happiest of human beings,” said she,
as she returned Mrs. Benson’s fond embrace—“perhaps——”
She had not
courage to finish the sentence.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Foolish girl!” said her father, as he
helped her into the carriage; “no more
whimpering. Now shut the door; bid
the man drive on: and you, Mrs. Benson,
my good woman, do you go away
to your bed. Pretty wild doings these!
This comes of connecting oneself with
quality!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The horses set off; and the rapidity
with which they went, the feeling that
she was hurrying to the object of all her
wishes, and the fresh air of a fine summer’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>night, all helped to compose and
revive poor Emmeline; so that, at Dover,
Mr. Benson, with a lightened heart, resigned
her to the care of Mr. Pelham’s
courier, whom they found there waiting
her orders. Her father offered himself
to go on with her to Paris; but that she
for many reasons declined; and at last
he consented to return to Charlton. He
first of all, however, went with her down
to the beach, saw her safe into the boat
that was to convey her to the vessel,
and, from the pier, watched its white
sails as long as he could, with his glass,
distinguish his daughter on the deck,
waving her many a farewell with his
handkerchief. At last, his dear Emmy
became a speck, and vanished. The
good man, then, brushing away a tear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>from his eye, and ejaculating to himself
a benediction on his darling, returned
alone to the inn, and resumed his journey
homewards.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>With</span> all superior characters, such as
Emmeline’s, the mind so supports the
body, that, for the time, it is rather
strengthened than exhausted by exertion.
Although her health had been impaired,
and her nerves much weakened, by all
she had lately undergone—yet, fearless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>of fatigue, she travelled on without stopping,
and arrived in Paris on the evening
of the third day from that on which
she had left Charlton.</p>
<p class='c013'>On entering the barriers, her heart
almost ceased to beat; and when she
drove into the court-yard of the hotel to
which the courier directed the postilions,
a death-like cold crept over her frame.
But at the door, she saw Mr. Pelham;
and the smile with which he welcomed
her again gave her life.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He is safe; he is out of danger;”
he hastily said, as he ventured to receive
in his arms Emmeline’s almost inanimate
form, and pressed her, as a brother
would a beloved sister, to his heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will he see me?” said Emmeline,
looking still doubtfully in Mr. Pelham’s
face.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“Soon, very soon,” said he; “but
you must compose yourself first; the
least agitation must be spared him.”
And he led her up stairs to Fitzhenry’s
apartments.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did he send for me?” said Emmeline
timidly, as soon as her agitations
allowed her to speak.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dear Lady Fitzhenry,” replied
Pelham, “I never have deceived you,
and will not do so now; Fitzhenry did
<i>not</i> send for you; did not even know of
my writing. At that time, in truth, I
despaired of his life; but I know my
friend well enough to be convinced, that
had he had a moment’s composure, he
would have been glad to have had it in
his power to demand and obtain your
forgiveness. It has pleased Heaven to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>give a more favourable issue to this illness
than I then had dared to anticipate.
Fitzhenry is now pronounced out of
danger, but he is in a state of weakness
that, of course, has necessarily precluded
all conversation on that, or any
other subject. Therefore your presence
here is no way expected by him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Emmeline’s countenance fell;—a
thousand vague hopes and expectations
were in an instant crushed!</p>

<p class='c013'>Pelham observed her emotion, and
added: “I cannot attempt to excuse
my friend’s conduct; a strange infatuation
has blinded him, and, for a time,
clouded his better nature; but I am
much mistaken if that fatal madness
is not entirely and for ever at an end.”</p>

<p class='c013'>All must know how hard it is to bear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>the blank feeling of disappointment
when we have (even unreasonably)
raised our hopes as to some desired
bliss. Emmeline had pictured to herself
her husband changed—penitent—receiving
her to his heart; and, when
she learnt the real truth, she almost lost
the sense of happiness at his safety, in
the bitter feeling, that even though her
rival’s reign was over, still <i>she</i> had
never been thought of by him. She
covered her face with her hands, while
tears of mortification slowly stole down
her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile, the servants had unloaded
the carriage; and, as she heard
it driving out of the court-yard, Emmeline,
in the humiliating pain of disappointed
feelings, almost resolved instantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>to leave Paris, again return to
her father, and not force herself upon
one who evidently wished not for her.</p>

<p class='c013'>With this idea, she suddenly rose from
her seat. “I will see him once more,”
said she in a hurried manner: “could
I not unseen follow you into his room?
I will not speak to him—he shall not
see or hear me—I will leave him directly,
and for ever——” she added;
but in so low a voice that Pelham did
not catch the words; and, attributing
all her agitation to anxiety about her
husband’s safety, and thinking that nothing
but beholding him would satisfy
her as to his existence, he drew her arm
within his, and led the way to Fitzhenry’s
bed-room.</p>

<p class='c013'>On opening the door, the darkness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>seemed so total, every window being
closed, that Emmeline, satisfied she
could not be observed, followed Mr.
Pelham to the bed-side; the curtain
was down, so that she could not see
Fitzhenry’s face, but merely heard him
breathe; by degrees, as her eyes got
used to the obscurity, and judging by
his immovable stillness, that he had not
observed their entrance, she ventured
gently to put the curtain aside and look
on him. But to the fond eye of love
alone was he the same Fitzhenry from
whom she had parted scarcely a month
before. His eyes were closed; his cheek
was sunk and colourless; his brown
curly hair fell lank on his pale forehead,
which was contracted with the expression
of suffering.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>The sight was too much for her, and
totally overcame her recently-formed
resolution of leaving him for ever. She
sunk on her knees at his side; her hand
fell on his, which lay apparently lifeless
on the bed; and, in the agony of
her feelings, careless of consequences,
she covered with tears and with kisses,
that hand which she had never before
dared to touch; but which now felt not
her fervent lips; was insensible to her
burning tears, and lay passive within
hers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline remained fixed at the bed-side
of her husband. The former unhappiness
of their connexion, his indifference
and even apparent dislike, her own
punctilious distance of manner toward
him, all seemed now forgotten by her.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>In trembling anxiety, she watched each
heaving of his bosom, each movement of
his languid limbs; and how her heart
throbbed the first time his lips moved,
and that she heard his voice! It
was weak and hollow; but still it was
that voice which thrilled to her inmost
soul; he expressed a wish for something
to moisten his parched mouth; Pelham
brought the glass to Emmeline; her
trembling hand was steadied when she
held it to his lips, while she put her arm
round him to support his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>She now seemed his established sick
nurse: what she should do when his
amendment allowed him to know who it
was that was attending upon him, never
was talked of, indeed was never thought
of by Emmeline. To be allowed to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>him constantly, to perform for him the
offices of affection, was such happiness
that she would not destroy it by venturing
to look forward. She gave him all
his medicines. Sometimes, unconscious
what he did, he took hold of her hand,
and held it long within his; but, exhausted
apparently by his illness, he
never opened his eyes, never enquired
what he took, nor from whose hands he
received it. The physicians, however,
assured Emmeline, that this insensibility
was merely the natural consequence of
the violence of the fever through which
he had struggled, that they hourly saw
some amendment, and found increased
strength of pulse.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the second evening after her arrival,
he had sunk into something more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>like natural sleep than the state of stupor
in which he had hitherto lain. Fearful
of moving, and thereby of disturbing
him, Pelham had taken hold of
the first book he could reach, and was
reading it by the light of the lamp
in the sick room. Emmeline was sitting
at the foot of the bed, with
her eyes fixed on her husband’s countenance,
for it was serene and calm, and
had more of its own natural expression
than she had yet seen. At length, he
moved, passed his hand over his eyes,
which then rested on Emmeline, and
endeavoured to raise himself. She saw
that sensibility had returned; and not
daring to advance towards him herself,
she made sign to Mr. Pelham to come to
him.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“Where am I?” exclaimed Fitzhenry.—“I
have been very ill, Pelham, have I
not? I have no recollection—indeed,
my head is still confused. I could even
now fancy,” continued he, staring wildly
on Emmeline, “that I see Lady Fitzhenry
before me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, dear Fitzhenry,” replied his
friend, “you have been ill—long very
ill; but you are now pronounced to be
quite convalescent, and a few more
days will, I trust, restore you even to
strength.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But my head is so weak—you will
laugh at me Pelham—but I repeat it—I
could swear that at this moment I see
Lady Fitzhenry quite plainly sitting at
the end of my bed; but I suppose it is
all weakness, and that such odd delusions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>will go off—but how very strange
such fancies are!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would you wish it to be no fancy?”
said Pelham calmly: “would you like
your delirious vision to be realized?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Pelham, why do you talk in
that way to me? you will only confuse
my poor brain still more—you too well
know how impossible it is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you still fancy you see her?”
said Pelham.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Still—still: it is her very countenance,
her melancholy expression; and
she looks at me now—I almost fancy
I see her breathe and move—Oh! Pelham,
for God’s sake give me something to
rouse me out of this miserably nervous
state;” and Fitzhenry covered his eyes
with both his hands.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“Fitzhenry,” said Pelham, in a slow
but tremulous voice, frightened at the
possible effect of that which he was going
to impart,—“what if I were to
tell you that this is no sick dream—but
that the figure before you, is in truth
and reality Lady Fitzhenry, your Emmeline?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Fitzhenry gave a violent start, and
grasped Pelham’s hand—“Good God!
Lady Fitzhenry in reality, here!—Speak
to her Pelham—I dare not, cannot.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Emmeline, trembling with anxiety,
had not courage to move or utter
a single word, and during all this conversation
had appeared the phantom her
husband had taken her for.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fitzhenry!” said Pelham, “compose
yourself; you have nothing to fear from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Lady Fitzhenry; affection alone brought
her here—and you will at last be convinced,
that far from being hated, you
are loved as few can hope to be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it possible! do you not deceive
me?” said Fitzhenry, eagerly, a faint
smile playing on his lips as he turned
towards Emmeline. But she still, doubting
her happiness, remained immoveable.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What, Emmeline!” said he, “cannot
you forgive me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>At that name, at those words, all fear
forsook her; he held out to her his feeble
arms, and she rushed to his heart; his
head fell on her bosom; and, overcome
with his feelings, he wept like a child.
In a few minutes, he recovered himself,
and gazing in her face, their eyes met.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Oh! who can describe the happiness
of that moment? Emmeline read affection
in those eyes which she had never
before dared to encounter; and when
Fitzhenry again pressed her to his heart,
and, half timidly, kissed her burning
cheek,—at that minute she almost could
have wished to breathe her last, so perfect
was her bliss.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such emotion, however, was not good
for the invalid; and Pelham forced Emmeline
for a time to leave the room, till
she had recovered the power to endure
her happiness with composure. When
she returned, she again took her station,
in silence, by his bed-side. Fitzhenry
seized her hand, held it in both of his,
but spoke not. One minute, one look,
however, had sufficed to open their hearts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>to each other; no explanation was necessary;
indeed, Emmeline would have been
fearful of breaking the dream of felicity
in which she now lived, by one word
recalling the past.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fitzhenry now daily seemed to gain
strength. Occasionally, a short cough,
which the physicians pronounced to be
nervous, tormented him by disturbing
his rest; but his eyes looked less languid.
At times, some colour returned to his
cheeks; and, supported by cushions, he
could now sit up on a couch. And what
a delight it was to Emmeline to wait
upon him, to watch and prevent his
wishes; to smooth his pillow, and receive
in return a smile of kindness and
gratitude!</p>

<p class='c013'>Sometimes, however, a cloud would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>darken her present happiness. If Fitzhenry
was more than usually silent or
thoughtful, (and he now often fell into
long fits of deep abstraction,) then her
jealous fancy pictured to her that his
thoughts and affections were wandering
back to Lady Florence. When he talked
of England, of his wish to return home,
again she took alarm; and, in spite of
herself, interpreted his anxiety on the
subject into the desire again to be in
the same country with her rival—perhaps,
indeed, again to return to her
chains.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Florence had never yet been in
any way alluded to—Fitzhenry seemed
to shun the subject as much as Emmeline;
so that she hardly knew her fate,
hardly knew by how strong, or how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>feeble a tenure she held her present
felicity.</p>

<p class='c013'>One day, however, he suddenly seemed
to summon courage for some sort of
explanation between them. Emmeline
had, as usual, been arranging his sofa.
Her hand still lingered on the pillow
which supported him; and, after gazing
on it a minute, he seized it, and
looking attentively on her wedding-ring—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Emmeline,” said he, “give me back
that ring, you shall wear it no more; it
was one <i>de mauvaise augure</i>, and shall in
future live on my hand for a memento,
like Prince Cheri’s. I will marry you
over again with <i>this</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And, with a half melancholy smile, he
drew from his finger a small fretted gold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>ring, which appeared to have been intended
for a woman. At the same time,
apparently repeating some words to himself,
he put in its place that which he
had taken off Emmeline’s hand. “Give
me a prayer-book,” said he; “and look
for the marriage ceremony, for I have
forgotten what I then promised.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When he got the book, he read it to
himself for some time in silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good God!” he at length exclaimed,
“did I pronounce these words? did I
make those vows? villain that I was!
Emmeline, can you forgive the past?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! do not talk of the past,” she
eagerly exclaimed; “I am too happy now
to wish to think of it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But what an awful account I shall
have to give,” added he, again casting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>his eyes on the book recording his solemn
engagement with God.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dearest Fitzhenry!” said Emmeline,
sinking on her knees beside him,
“a God of mercy will forgive all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pray to him for me,” said he, in a
low tone; “I fear I cannot. I never
prayed!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline shuddered, she seized his
hand: “Oh! Fitzhenry, talk not so
wildly; God is now calling you to him,
shrink not from him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Fitzhenry pressed her hand; again
took the prayer-book, and with a tremulous
voice read these words:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I, Ernest, take thee, Emmeline, to
my wedded wife, to love and to cherish;
and forsaking all other, keep myself
only unto thee as long as we both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>shall live; and thereto I plight thee my
troth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The last words died on his lips, and
closing his eyes, he sank back, seemingly
both affected and exhausted. Emmeline
was too much moved to speak: she
pressed to her lips and to her heart, that
hand now a second time given her—but
in how different a manner!</p>

<p class='c013'>From that day, Emmeline’s prayer-book
was his constant companion. She
saw his mind was deeply affected, and
left the strong impression to work its
own effect.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>A few</span> days after the scene recorded in
the last chapter, when Fitzhenry appeared
better than he had yet done since
his illness, and that he had even some
of his own natural and playful cheerfulness,
“Lady Fitzhenry,” said he, with a
smile, “how long is it since you have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>liked me—<i>loved</i> me?” added he faintly,
colouring.</p>
<p class='c013'>Emmeline coloured too. “Oh! I can’t
remember,” said she; “I tried to hate
you, for I felt it my duty to myself to
do so; but somehow, from the very first,
I could not.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How strange!” continued Fitzhenry;
“I should not have thought I could have
been so very blind and stupid. Our sex
is pretty clear-sighted where our vanity
is concerned; but I suppose I was so
conscious that I deserved to be hated
by you, that I convinced myself I was so;
and every, even the slightest occurrence,
confirmed me more and more in this
opinion. Perhaps too I felt (at first at
least) that it was an ease to my conscience
to think you disliked me, trying
to persuade myself in that manner that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>we were quits. Pelham, when he came
to Arlingford, soon saw how things were,
and took me to task—he had known me
long; known all my history.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Fitzhenry paused: at length, resuming
in a lower, graver tone—“Emmeline!
my wife!” said he, “I must ease
my mind by confessing all to you. I
have loved—madly loved—it was a delirium,
an intoxication, an infatuation—but
on my honour, before God!” and he
fervently clasped his hands together—“before
God, I swear it is over. My
esteem, my admiration, all is now, indeed
has long been, yours.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Fitzhenry had left out the word love;
and Emmeline missed it. She turned
away her face from her husband, but not
so quick as to prevent his observing the
change in her countenance; and, drawing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>her towards him, he (smiling) added,
“And my love too.” Still Emmeline kept
her eyes averted. “Listen to my story,”
said Fitzhenry, “and then you will believe
me. I need not tell you in what a
pretty humour I was married. Good
God! when I recollect the state of mind
in which I was—that dreadful day—I
really now wonder how I got through it
all as well as I did.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I resolved on civil indifference towards
you; and, at the beginning, it
was easy enough to keep to my resolution,
although from the first, your conduct
astonished, and consequently interested
me. I expected reproaches,
sullenness, or childish repinings, and
complaint, but found sweetness, good
sense, and delicacy. Emmeline! I
could swear that you never in your life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>suffered as I did that morning after our
marriage, when I had to encounter
you in the breakfast-room. You held
out your hand to me—there was a smile
on your face, that went to my heart
as a dagger. That day however over,
my thoughts and feelings returned into
their former channel, and I was so entirely
engrossed by them, that my remorse
died away. I persuaded myself I
behaved vastly well to you, and that you
thoroughly deserved that fate which you
had brought on yourself. The civil indifference
which I determined to maintain
in my conduct towards you, soon,
however, became difficult to pursue.
There was sometimes an archness in
your smiles—in your look and manner—an
appearance of reading my thoughts,
and laughing at the awkward situation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>in which I had placed myself, that piqued
me, and made me almost in awe of you.
I was often, too, I am ashamed to say it,
provoked with you for your patient good
humour, for not seeming to feel my
abominable conduct towards you more.
But, at others, I found <i>you</i> whom I had
resolved to disregard—to dislike—to my
surprise, I found you (forgive the seeming
impertinence of the expression) a
most intelligent, conversible companion;
and more than once I caught myself
owning how agreeable you were.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, although such thoughts at times
occupied me, still my affections were
so strongly engaged—my whole soul so
enthralled by mad passion, that they were
but passing thoughts; the impression, as
yet, was not deep. I then left home for
some time, and returned to you with all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>my old feelings strengthened. I had renewed
all my vows of constancy, of
fidelity to another, perfectly regardless
of the solemn, sacred engagement, into
which I had entered with you—(profligate,
unprincipled villain that I was!)
Wishing to avoid, in future, the possibility
of a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with you, I had invited
several friends to meet me at Arlingford,
on my return there. I thought
that by that means, we might avoid even
the common intimacy produced by living
under the same roof, and meeting daily,
as I flattered myself that you would be
lost in the mass. But that plan failed.
I heard your name, your praises, from
every one, and every where. Your voice
always attracted my attention, and the
very resolution to slight, and dislike you,
made me constantly occupied about you.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>“Among the party then at Arlingford,
you remember, was Pelham. He had
come to England, on purpose to see me,
and to make your acquaintance. Knowing
my former history, he had, as a true
friend, rejoiced at my marriage, for I
had basely concealed from him the circumstances
that had attended it, fearing
his strict integrity; but, when living with
us, it was impossible for him long to remain
ignorant of our real situation. I
was forced to confess all to him; and
he did not spare me. He persecuted me
eternally with your perfections. I allowed
that you possessed sense, acquirements,
gentleness, most pleasing manners; but
I insisted upon your total want of feeling,
on your having no heart; and I brought,
as proofs of my assertions, your apparent
perfect contentment under circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>that would have roused the anger, if not
broken the heart, of any woman who had
a particle of sensibility. Even on that
point he would not give way; and, one
evening, while the whole party were busily
employed in dancing, and you were
engaged at the piano-forte, we were
discussing the subject pretty warmly,
(something that had passed having given
rise to it,) and Pelham was maintaining
you were <i>even</i> much <i>attached</i> to <i>me</i>;
when a break in the music, a sudden
burst of voices, and your name often repeated,
made me turn round, and I beheld
you in apparent gaiety of heart,
waltzing joyously by yourself—‘Look
there,’ said I to Pelham, (with the true
selfish pride and impertinence of man,)
‘look at the sentimental girl, who is
dying for love of me.’</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“Pelham stared at you in astonishment.
He was silenced; for, at that
moment, I am sure he read you as little
aright as myself. As for me, I at first
looked at you in scorn; but other feelings
soon succeeded. You were, at that
minute, perfectly beautiful; there was a
look of wild enjoyment, a brilliancy in
your complexion, a grace in your person,
that fixed my attention, and, in
spite of myself, forced my admiration.
I had never seen any one, (any <i>but one</i>,)
waltz so well: at that moment, I almost
thought I had never seen any one so
lovely. The truth was, I seldom before
had ever looked at you attentively,
for I feared to encounter your eyes, and
somehow they always instantly seemed
to know when mine were directed towards
you.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>“For an instant, I was lost in admiration,
as I followed your light form round
the room; so I suppose was Pelham,
for our argument seemed totally forgotten
by us both. Suddenly you came up to
me, and seized my arm. Had the marble
statue left its pedestal, and done the
same, I could scarcely have started more
violently beneath its grasp. I was altogether
so thrown off my guard, that I
hardly knew what to say or do. Your
conduct surprised, (I must own,) even
disgusted me; I thought it was no subject
for a <i>joke</i>, and that there was a want
of delicacy in thus braving me. You
may remember I was made to waltz
with you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline’s deep crimson showed she
remembered it well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fitzhenry pressed her hand, which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>held still more closely, and continued—“It
seemed to me to be all a concerted
plan to torment me; my momentary trance
of admiration was dispelled, and was
succeeded by feelings very opposite.
You then appeared to me to endeavour,
by old and hacknied arts of coquetry, to
attract my attention: you fell almost
entirely into my arms; you laid your
head on my shoulder, and complained
of faintness. I cannot describe the
strange mixture of feelings which at
that moment took possession of me—for
though, even then I fancied I disliked
you, yet, I verily believe regret and disappointment
were uppermost on discovering
(as I thought I then did) the common-place,
artful nature of your character.
To extricate myself from you was,
however, my first object; and, under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>pretext of gallant attention, I directly left
the room to procure a glass of water.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In truth, your indisposition was evidently
not feigned, for you were as pale
as death; but in my vexation I would
not own that even to myself. I was in
a devil of a humour all that evening.
The next day Moore made that foolish
piece of work about the brooch, (which
circumstance, by the bye, I still don’t
comprehend); however, I know well that
I wrote you some <i>impertinence</i>. What, I
don’t recollect, and I suspect I had better
not remember. It seemed to me that you
and Moore were in a league to plague and
provoke me; and I hated you both most
cordially. I felt it was impossible to
go on in this way; and, to put an end to
the whole thing, I pretended sudden
and violent zeal for the welfare of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>country, and announced my intention to
go early to town, to attend parliament.
But it was not politics which took me
there; nor did I, as I believe I basely
let you imagine, pass my days and nights
in the House of Commons.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But my conscience was perfectly at
rest, for your conduct then seemed to sanction
mine. You plunged madly into dissipation,
and for days together, although living
under the same roof, we often did not
meet. I believe I again gave a sigh when
I thought how I had been mistaken in your
character, for I had fancied there was,
at least, nothing of frivolity in it, and had
frequently been forced to confess to myself,
that had I been free, and to choose
one who would have suited me as a wife,
(barring your supposed want of feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>and tenderness of nature,) I should have
chosen you. On the whole, however, I
rejoiced at your apparent levity of disposition.
I felt as if I thus regained my
liberty, and that your follies excused
my faults. It seemed to me that it was
by mutual consent that we then each went
our own way. But mine was no longer
one of pleasantness. I felt—and yet
the feeling was pain—I felt I did not
love as I had done. I saw her as she
was, wanting all that beauty of innocence,
of virtue, which you so eminently
possessed; but, still infatuated, I sought
her society although the charm was gone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We had not been long in town, however,
before a strange madness came
over me. I hardly know how, or when
it began. You had general success——were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>universally admired; but I fancied
that <i>Pelham in particular admired you</i>;
and, when once that thought had taken
possession of my mind, every trifling
circumstance gave it additional certainty;
till one night, at Almacks, I surprised
you together in such earnest conversation,
and in such evident emotion,
that I had no longer a doubt left on the
subject. Although I had voluntarily
rejected your affections, and repulsed
you from me, yet I could not bear that
another should awaken feelings which I
had tried to persuade myself you did not
possess. I really believe I was vain and
ridiculous enough to want you to love
me, when I had no intention of returning
the partiality, and certainly made
no attempt to inspire it. I had sought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Pelham that evening, having something
of consequence to say to him; but when
I saw you, I totally forgot my errand.
I looked at you stedfastly, to try and
read your heart. You blushed deeply.
How can I own my folly, my perverseness,
my inconsistency! I gazed on you
in jealousy! for I then saw and acknowledged
your attractions: I saw that
your smiles, your gaiety, your bloom
was gone. I saw that some secret sorrow
had changed the character of your
countenance, had altered the whole tone
of your mind, and of your manners. But,
every way totally deceived, I never once
dreamt I was the cause of that sorrow.</p>

<p class='c013'>“At Easter, I would not go to Arlingford,
for if I had, there could have been
no reason why you, why Pelham, should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>not have accompanied me, and I did not
feel that I could have stood the trial. So
I went to Mostyn Hall; but, on my honour,
it was more to avoid you, and Pelham,
than to seek her; for all was there
changed. Suspicion and discontent now
poisoned our intercourse; and when I
called to mind your gentleness, your
feminine <i>home</i> perfections, she fell still
lower in the comparison. I was then
summoned home on account of poor
Reynolds’s illness; she ridiculed my
feelings for him; but, for the first time,
I disregarded her raillery, I resisted her
allurements, and set off directly for Arlingford.
You may imagine what was
the effect produced on my mind, when
on opening the door of the invalid’s room,
I beheld you kneeling by the bed of my
old servant. I had no idea you were at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Arlingford. I had left you apparently
engrossed by the world and its dissipation.
Indeed, according to the suspicions
of my jealous fancy, by still more
powerful attractions, and could hardly
believe my senses. Oh! how my heart
at that minute smote me for my hasty
and seemingly unjust judgment of
you.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor Reynolds, you may remember,
joined our hands; an unaccountable
fear, shyness, I know not what,
came over me. I had not courage to
retain your hand when you withdrew it
from mine; I felt you were a being too
pure, too good for me; and I allowed
you to fly from me. Reynolds talked to
me much about you—told me long stories
about your goodness, your affection for
me—about having found you gazing on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>my picture, and I know not what; but I
fancied his mind began to wander; that I
could not trust to what he said; in short,
I would not be convinced, although I
wished it. But still his exhortations,
the awfulness of the scene, and my own
accusing conscience, all combined to
work on my feelings; and I resolved, the
first moment I could, to leave him to go
to you, seek an explanation, and implore
your forgiveness.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When I reached your door for that
purpose, my heart beat with various
contending feelings. I hardly knew what
I said; I longed to fall at your feet, to
ask you to forgive and love me. A word,
a look of kindness on your part would
then have fixed our fate—one smile, and
I should have caught you to my heart——been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>yours for ever. But I found you
cold, distant, and for the first time, since
I had known you, even irritated and repulsive.
There were traces of tears on
your face, which you endeavoured to
hide from me; your whole manner betrayed
emotion and feelings, which you
wished to conceal. I saw then, as I
thought, but too plainly, how it was—all
combined to deceive me. Mrs. Osterley’s
thoughtless hints came to my mind,
and confirmed me in my suppositions. I
fancied that the case was hopeless. My
pride then closed both my heart, and lips,
and I would not confess to you feelings
which I was convinced you could not
now return.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As I was leaving you, by accident
your hair—one of these beautiful long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>ringlets—got entangled on the button of
my coat sleeve. Had you been forced
to touch a serpent, you could not have
recoiled from it with more horror than
you did from me. Do you remember
all that Lady Fitzhenry? and pray how
do you explain your conduct?” said he,
smiling.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In the whole of your supposed love-story,
for ‘Pelham’ read ‘Ernest,’” answered
Emmeline, in a low voice, as she
hid her face on his shoulder, “and all
will be fully explained.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What a pity it was, that we were
both so proud or so stupid!” continued
Fitzhenry, sighing deeply as he gazed
on her in tenderness: “I was both,
and left you in anger; although, I confess,
I had little right to take the matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>up in that manner. The next day, provoked
with you, with myself, miserable
every way, I would not attempt to detain
you at Arlingford, though I ardently
wished it; I only read impatience to
return to Pelham in your resolved departure,
and would not for the world
have allowed you to think I wished you
to remain. I remember, however, that
as you drove from the door, you cast
back one look—one melancholy look,
which shot as a ray of light through my
heart; (for I was watching you from my
room;) had I been at the door, I believe,
even then I should have endeavoured
to stop you; but, before I had
time to decide, you drove off. I then
persuaded myself that the look of regret
which I had fancied I had seen on your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>countenance was mere fancy; I took
your thus leaving me as declared war on
your part; and, when I joined you in
town, I determined that my conduct
should be such as (fool, idiot, that I
was!) I thought befitting my pride and
honour—fine sounding words, which I put
in the place of selfishness and passion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In consequence of this resolution,
I totally neglected you; we ceased almost
entirely to speak to each other
when we did chance to meet, and I returned
in desperation to your rival.
I endeavoured in her society to forget
every thing, to banish from my mind you
Emmeline, my friend, and all the dreams
of happiness—of domestic happiness
which now eternally haunted me. But
in vain! the fascination of her society
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>was gone—we were both changed; it
was impossible to recall feelings which
truth had destroyed. She could not
again blind me; suspicion made her
<i>exigeante</i>—her thraldom became insupportable;
my feelings, my temper, both
were irritated beyond my control; my
mind was sick, as my body now is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>For a minute or two, Fitzhenry hid
his face in his hands, and seemed lost
in no pleasing recollections; at length,
after a deep-drawn sigh, (whether of
regret or repentance Emmeline could
not decide,) he continued:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I now come to the last and the
worst part of my story. I would fain
forget it all; but Emmeline, you shall
know the very worst; shall be aware
what a hot-headed fool you have to deal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>with, and then you must still love me if
you can. I think I need hardly ask, if
you remember a certain Saturday night
at the opera. By accident, I happened
to know, that you had, that night, given
away your box; and, therefore, feeling
secure you would not be there, had
agreed to accompany Lady Florence; for,
abominably as I had behaved, you must
do me the justice to allow, I never so
far insulted you as openly before you to
be seen with your rival; how much
certain selfish feelings and awkward
uncomfortable sensations of shame influenced
me, I will not pretend to say.
Well, I joined Lady Florence. After
I had been with her a few minutes, she
carelessly told me, she believed she had
seen you. I directly looked round to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>the box which she said she had observed
you enter; but, not being able to distinguish
you, I was satisfied that she must
have been mistaken. Presuming on her
former power, she then spoke of you.
I could not bear to hear your name in
her mouth; I felt it almost an insult to
myself. She spoke too of you with a
sort of ridicule and levity that disgusted
me; she hinted at the attachment between
you and Pelham, and seemed to
enjoy the pain she saw she was inflicting.
Although a smile was on her
lips, yet her eyes flashed fire—the fire
of jealousy and revenge. This, in the
present state of my feelings, was not
to be endured. I dared not speak; I
knew too well also the violence of her
temper; it was not the moment for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span><i>scene</i>, and I said not a word; but still,
there I remained, as if spell-bound.
My mind was, however, busily at work,
and I formed many resolutions for extricating
myself, from my present miserable
situation. You then rose to my imagination,
gay, blooming, gentle, artless,
as you were when I first took you to
Arlingford; when I had sworn to love and
protect you; and had then basely repulsed,
and abandoned to your hard fate.
My conscience smote me sorely. I felt
how greatly I had injured you; that, young
and inexperienced as you were, I had,
by my cruelty and neglect, driven you
into danger. I thought, perhaps, you
still had not wandered so far, but that
your affections might yet be recalled.
On my honour, Emmeline, infatuated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>as I was, I had then no doubt of your
innocence, your purity, your virtue.
Nor could I even bring myself to suspect
Pelham’s honour. That you loved each
other, I did not doubt; but I respected
you both too much to think I had been
injured by you. I resolved, in short,
that, on that very night, we should open
our hearts to each other; that all should
be explained between us. I determined
to propose to you, Emmeline, to leave
town with me—to leave England directly,
and by mutual forgiveness, to make
up for the past, and begin a new life of
penitence—I hoped finally of happiness.
Lost in these thoughts, I sat unconscious
of what was passing around me, till the
falling of the curtain roused me from my
trance. Lady Florence then seized my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>arm. She saw she had displeased me;
feared she had gone too far, and would
not quit her hold. When we reached
the lobby, I saw you and Pelham. I
hurried her down stairs in the opposite
direction; but she had seen you too,
and I could distinguish a smile of triumph
on her countenance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What happened afterwards you know.
The two carriages had got entangled,
for your coachman, Emmeline, was fighting
your battle for you, and contending
with Lady Florence Mostyn’s. In the
confusion I caught a glimpse of you, at
the moment when she had fallen back
into my arms. I heard the coarse jokes
of the mob of footmen as your carriage
drove off. I was nearly frantic. Florence
had been slightly hurt, was still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>frightened, and nervous. I could not
be so brutal as to leave her in that state.
I went home with her. I meant calmly,
kindly, to speak to her; to represent the
misery of our intercourse—in short, to
open my heart to her. But the instant
she suspected my meaning—overpowered
by her passions, her fury knew
no bounds, nor her envenomed malice
and jealousy towards you. My blood
fired—a violent scene ensued. I left her
in anger——and fully resolved for ever.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Fitzhenry had latterly spoken so quick,
that he paused for a minute, as if exhausted
and overcome by his feelings;
but Emmeline was too much interested
and agitated by the narration to make
any comment; and, after a moment’s
total silence between them, he continued,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>although in a still more perturbed
manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hurried home—I was in that feverish
state of mind, when to think, to pause,
is impossible. I felt I must instantly
throw myself at your feet, that our fate
must be that minute determined. I meant
to propose to you to set off for Dover
that very night. I had ceased to love
<i>her</i>; but my mind was torn with contending
feelings, my brain was on fire.
As soon as I reached home, I rushed up
stairs—I heard Pelham’s voice in the
drawing-room—the door was not closed,
my ear caught these words, ‘Honour—you
may trust me’—(and you will allow
those are awkward words for a husband
to overhear addressed to his wife.) I was
determined to be satisfied at once—to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>have all doubts removed. I burst into
the room; and my worst suspicions were
confirmed. Pelham had hold of your
hand; you were close to him; your head
rested on him—you were violently agitated—both
started on seeing me—you
were both evidently discomposed, and
thrown off your guard. Was it strange
that I converted all this into evidences
of guilt? I had just enough command
over myself not to speak. You attempted
some excuse for the situation in which I
found you. Your effrontery surprised and
shocked me. At that minute, I totally
forgot your wrongs and my own conduct,
and I only considered myself as basely
betrayed and injured. Pelham then followed
you to the door of your own room;
he said something to you in a low voice——again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>he took your hand. All that before
my face was too much. I wonder how I
contained the rage that burned within
me. I felt that I could not then discuss
the matter with him, and I left the house
like a madman. I paced up and down
the street, and watched for Pelham’s departure
before I returned home; giving
way to all the delirium of passion, and
distracted by all the misery of doubt.
My first impulse was to write to him,
imperiously to demand an explanation of
his conduct, and satisfaction for my injured
honour. Heavens! to think that
I sought an opportunity to deprive of
life Pelham, my best, my tried, my
devoted friend! I passed the night
writing letter after letter to you both,
and destroying them as fast as I wrote.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>By degrees, however, my passion cooled;
I sometimes thought, and fondly hoped,
I might be mistaken. When I recalled
to mind my friend’s strict principles of
virtue and integrity—principles that had
so often made me blush for my faults—I
could not think that what I suspected
was possible, strong as appearances were
against you both. Your virtues too, Emmeline,
your look of artless innocence,
haunted me. How could I reconcile
your present supposed conduct with all
those perfections which I had so admired
in you?</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hours passed on, daylight returned.
The servants began to stir about the
house. I heard footsteps in the room
above—in your room, Lady Fitzhenry.
Every minute I expected some message
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>from you, some note, some explanation
in short; and kept my letter to Pelham
unsealed, still hoping I might have been
in error, and that something would undeceive
me. I soon, however, heard
preparations for your departure; your
leaving my house thus, without even
taking leave of me, I interpreted into a
decided resolution on your part that a
final, formal separation should take place
between us. You had said you were
going to Charlton. I sometimes hardly
believed that you were really going there,
and, in frantic moments, I suspected the
worst. But at others, when my own
conduct forced itself on my mind, when
I reflected on your wrongs, I then thought
that, exasperated probably by my ill
treatment, you were leaving my roof for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>ever, determined, perhaps, that the law
should dissolve an union which had
been but a source of misery to you, in
order that you might legally unite yourself
to the man you loved. Again, had
not pride restrained me, I would have
sought that explanation which I longed
for, and then all would soon have been
understood between us; had our eyes but
met, we must, at that moment, have read
each other’s hearts; but in proud, sullen
silence, I awaited some opening from you.</p>

<p class='c013'>“None came; at length your carriage
drove up to the door; I heard your footsteps
on the stairs; you stopped at my
door; my heart beat to suffocation; I
thought, nay, I felt almost sure that you
were coming to me; my hand was actually
on the lock to open it; just then I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>heard one of the servants speaking to you,
you passed on—I heard the carriage-door
shut, and you drove off. I felt that we had
parted for ever; and, when too late, I regretted
the blessing I had thrown away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My Emmeline, I am not <i>now</i> ashamed
to own to you, that I wept in bitterness
of heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The instant you were gone, in desperation
I sealed and directed my abominable
letter to Pelham. I ordered
post horses directly, desiring that the
carriage should follow me to his lodgings.
On arriving there, I learnt he
was gone out of town. This confirmed
all to me; I tore open my letter, said
we could never again meet but in <i>one</i>
way, and for <i>one</i> purpose. That I was
going instantly to Arlingford, that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>might there follow me, and give me the
satisfaction I demanded, unless indeed
he was already far off with another.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How perverse is human nature!
Man’s nature at least. On my arrival
at Arlingford, I missed you whom I had
always before shunned, at every turn.
I missed the gentle being who had so
long, so patiently submitted to my most
impertinent vagaries. I missed my poor
victim! Every room, every inanimate
object recalled her who would have
given to all such a charm! I spent hours
in your room, Emmeline, in useless, tormenting
regrets. In that room which I
had hitherto avoided with such care!
Alternately condemning myself and you,
I felt that I had lost every thing—I was
completely miserable!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>Greatly exhausted by this narration,
during which Fitzhenry had often been
interrupted by his cough, he leant back
on the couch. The door, at that moment
gently opened, and Pelham appeared.
On observing the very visible
signs of emotion on both his friends
countenances, he was again hastily retreating,
when Fitzhenry called to him—“No,
come in, Pelham; what we were
talking about need be no secret from
you, for indeed you are principally concerned.
I was telling Emmeline all my
history. In other words, confessing all
my faults; and as you are, God knows,
well acquainted with both, I wish you
would relieve me, by bringing the narrative
to a conclusion; I have owned to
her all my strange fears and fancies, my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>suspicions even of you. Can you, Pelham,
ever forgive and forget them? can
you forgive the ravings of a madman,
for such they now appear to me to have
been.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t be too humble in your apologies
to me,” said Pelham, smiling—“for
I am not sure how far I am myself innocent,
if it is guilt to esteem, to admire,
to——” Pelham stopped, for a
minute. “In short,” added he—“I had
more than half a mind to punish you,
Fitzhenry, for your extreme stupidity;
and endeavour myself to win the pearl
of great price which you rejected; but,
from the first, I had, luckily for me, penetration
sufficient to discover that the
attempt would be perfectly hopeless.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Pelham said this in the light tone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>of pleasantry; but, as he spoke, his eyes
glanced mournfully on Emmeline, and a
slight tinge of red momentarily suffused
his sallow cheek. But his emotion totally
escaped Emmeline’s observation,
whose eyes and attention were entirely
fixed on her husband, fearful of losing a
word, or look.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fitzhenry, however, saw all; his eye
moistened as he held out his hand to his
friend, and warmly pressed his within
it. “Well Pelham, now you must take
up our history from my sudden departure
for Arlingford, where you found me;
and do not spare me; I deserve thoroughly
the worst you may be tempted to say of
me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t be afraid, my good friend,” replied
Pelham; “I am, you know, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>apt to compliment you.—Well, Lady Fitzhenry,
to go back to that fatal Saturday
night: Fitzhenry had appeared in so
strange a mood when we then parted, so
agitated, so unlike himself, that I had
determined to be in Grosvenor-street
early next morning; but the arrival of a
courier from the continent with dispatches
of importance, obliged me directly to repair
to our foreign minister’s: he was,
I found, gone to his villa at Putney;
thither I followed him, and was there
detained so long on business, which could
not be deferred, that I did not get back
to town till late in the afternoon. I
drove straight to Grosvenor-street, and
learnt, to my surprise, that both of you
had left London—but not together. I
feared something disagreeable had passed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>and when I reached my own house,
I found Fitzhenry’s letter, which confirmed
my apprehensions. I declare, that
at first I thought he was mad—and could
scarcely guess what he meant, what he
could allude to. Although obliged in
four and twenty hours to leave England,
yet I could not go without seeing him,
without endeavouring at least to clear
up all this sad misunderstanding; and
I lost no time in repairing to Arlingford.
It is fortunate that I am by nature blest
with a very calm temperament, otherwise
this meeting might possibly have
ended in our running each other through
the body. But Fitzhenry and I had
been too long real friends for any <i>unfounded</i>
misunderstanding long to exist
between us.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>“I at length succeeded in convincing
him how perfectly absurd and unjust
his suspicions were, as far as I was myself
concerned. But there, my powers
of persuasion ended: he would listen to
nothing I could say about you, Lady
Fitzhenry: you hated him, he said; if it
was not me whom you preferred, it was
some one else. You were quite changed
towards him—he could hardly blame you,
but things had now gone too far to allow
of any hope of reconciliation. You had
left his house in anger, just anger—gone
to your father’s; had probably told
him all, intending no doubt to insist
on a formal separation—on a divorce.
Perhaps legal proceedings were already
commenced against him. And whatever
he might suffer, he could, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>would, only acquiesce in whatever you
chose to dictate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fitzhenry then repeated to me again
and again, all his <i>proofs</i> of your indifference
and dislike,—all which were only
proofs of his own blind infatuation. In
short, poor fellow,” added Mr. Pelham,
smiling—“he talked a great deal of
nonsense. However, at last, by setting
up my proofs in opposition to his, I succeeded
in extorting from him an agreement,
that he would go with me directly
to Charlton. I was first to see you
alone, and he promised that he would
then be guided by my judgment as to
his own conduct. The carriage which
was to convey us to you was actually
at the door, but, unfortunately, Fitzhenry,
who was in a state of diseased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>anxiety, and restlessness of mind, insisted
on waiting for the arrival of the
post; it brought no letter from you,
(which was what he had secretly hoped
for,) but one from his father, that immediately
destroyed all I had been labouring
to accomplish. Gossip had been busy
with you and your husband; indeed had
even brought in my name. The scene
which took place at the opera, your
both abruptly leaving town—these circumstances,
put together, and enlarged
upon, had been formed into a regular
story of rupture, elopement, duel, and
the Lord knows what, till at last it found
its way into the newspapers, I was told;
and thus reached Lord Arlingford, who,
much alarmed at the report, wrote directly
to his son, entreating him to consider
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>well what he was about; to break
off immediately a connexion which was
now become so public, and consequently
so disgraceful, and endeavour to be reconciled
to his wife.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So far all was well; but unfortunately
the arguments he used were the last to
influence your husband’s noble mind,
for they were those of interest. Knowing
Lord Arlingford as well as he did,
at any other time Fitzhenry would have
treated such a hint with the contempt it
deserved; but he was then no way himself—he
tore his father’s letter into a
thousand pieces, and, with a bitter
smile, while his face was ghastly pale
said, ‘he is right, quite right; it is my
<i>interest</i> to be reconciled to Lady Fitzhenry—no
power on earth shall make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>me seek her forgiveness—the first overtures
must come from herself. Even
you surely would not have me go as a
beggar, and sue and humble myself to
her father: what an honourable appearance
would repentance have just now!
No, Pelham, I will not do it; and any
attempt to persuade me to such a step,
I warn you, will be perfectly vain.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“During our friend’s own story,”
continued Pelham, “I think, Lady
Fitzhenry, he has probably let you a
little into the secret of his character;
and, therefore, I may venture to say,
that pride is his besetting sin. Had I
but hinted this at that time, I suppose
he would have knocked me down; but
we have him in our power now; and
who would believe, seeing him, as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>now is, so meek, so humble, so contrite,
and subdued, what a perfect devil
he was then!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come, come, Pelham,” said Fitzhenry,
while his pale face was slightly
coloured: “you are a little exceeding
the liberty I gave—tell the story fairly,
but no comments. Let Lady Fitzhenry
find out my faults herself; she will do
that quite soon enough without your
assistance; indeed, God knows she has
had full opportunity already——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Fitzhenry has but one fault
to find,” interrupted Emmeline, as she
looked half reproachfully in her husband’s
face: “it is that you persist in
calling her by that cruel formal name.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bad old habits, my Emmeline,” he
replied smiling; “which, if they offend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>you, shall be conquered; but I <i>could</i> explain
why I never <i>now</i> pronounce that
name without feelings very, very different
from those of coldness or dislike;
do I not by it claim you as my own?
But I want to have done with my history.
So go on, Pelham, only remember
no annotations and reflections.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was ignorant of what had passed
between Fitzhenry and Lady Florence,”
continued Pelham, almost tempted to
smile at his friend’s sickly petulance:
“he had never named her. Had I known
of their rupture, I should immediately
have entreated you, Lady Fitzhenry, to
have come, or at least to have written to
him; but not aware of that connexion
being at an end, I could not advise a
step, which I felt you could hardly take,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>and which I thought, indeed, would do
little good if all was to go on as it had
done for some months past. Fitzhenry
was seemingly wretched; but so he had
long been. I had undeceived him as far
as was possible for me to do with regard
to your feelings towards him, and I certainly
felt it was for him to seek you,
and to implore your forgiveness.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hopeless, therefore, of bringing
about a reconciliation between you at
that moment, I informed him of my necessary
and immediate departure for the
continent, and proposed his accompanying
me; I thought, by that means, the
fatal connexion which seemed the bar to
your mutual happiness might be broken;
and, knowing well your heart, and certain
that affection would, with you, get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>the better of every other feeling, I
trusted that time and circumstances
would restore you to each other. Fitzhenry
directly with eagerness caught at
the idea of leaving England: ‘it is the
best thing for us all,’ said he: ‘and it
will break to Florence what at present
I cannot say—cannot write to her.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“On our way to town, however, being
still unwilling to give up all hope,
and still thinking it was incumbent on
Fitzhenry to make the first advances to
you, I formed a little plan to decoy your
husband to Charlton on our road to
Dover, and I pleased myself with thinking
that I might, by this very allowable
artifice, be the means of bringing about
your mutual happiness; but something
betrayed my scheme; and, as soon as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>suspected my intention, he was thrown
into a state of violence and irritation of
temper, in which I had never before
seen him, and which really alarmed me.
It was Mr. Benson’s presence which he
dreaded, I believe: he could have laid
his pride, (that stumbling-block of his,)
at your feet Lady Fitzhenry, but he
could not humble himself before others.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed, Emmeline,” said Fitzhenry,
interrupting him, “again Pelham barely
does me justice; it was not pride that
made me dread encountering you. On
the contrary, it was shame, fear, humility,
and all those perfectly contrary
feelings.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poh! poh! don’t let him take you in
with all that pretty sounding humbug,”
continued Pelham, laughing. “However,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>the real truth was, that he was as
unlike his real self then, as, I am sorry
to say, he is in many respects now. As
we proceeded, I became more and more
convinced that he was far from well.
During the journey, I made little progress
with my headstrong companion in
my attempts to bring him to reason, and
at last his answers became so strange and
incoherent, that I was really alarmed;
and, on our arrival here, I immediately
sent for a physician. He found him, as I
had suspected, in a high fever; and I am
convinced his illness (brought on probably
by agitation) had attacked his
brain even before it showed itself visibly
in his health; as at Arlingford, he certainly
was in a state of irritation perfectly
unnatural to him. Fortunately,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>the letters I here found enabled me to
delay my further journey for a short
time, in order to devote myself to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You now know all,” continued Pelham;
“and whatever my future lot in
life may be, it will be one gratifying recollection
that I was the means of
uniting two beings so formed for each
other, and whom I love so entirely.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Pelham seized Emmeline’s hand
as he uttered these words, and pressed
it to his lips. “Reward my friend for
his services to me and to yourself, Emmeline,”
said Fitzhenry, “by letting him
kiss that varying cheek of yours. Can
I give a stronger proof that my delirious
fever has quite left me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Pelham waited not for further leave;
he pressed her to his heart, and, as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>printed a fond kiss on her forehead,
“God bless you, Emmeline,—God bless
and protect you both!” he cried, with
emotion; “and in your future hours of
happiness remember me.” Then resuming
a more cheerful tone, he added:
“And now, my dear friends, that my
mind is at ease about you both, (for I do
not now apprehend a relapse of <i>any</i> sort,)
and that I can leave you, Fitzhenry, in
the care of so good a nurse, I must repair
to my post, and set off to-morrow morning
for Vienna, in case any longer delay
should bring me to disgrace—as politics
have little respect for the feelings of
friendship.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>After</span> Mr. Pelham’s departure, Fitzhenry
became very impatient to return
to England. He was better certainly, and
had regained some degree of strength;
for now, leaning on Emmeline’s arm, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>was able to walk about his apartment;
but still he did not seem to recover as
rapidly as he should. A degree of varying
fever still hung about him; his cough,
which the French physician still called
nervous, at times exhausted him much,
and he had a look of languor quite unnatural
to him; his cheek remained hollow,
his eyes looked sunk.</p>
<p class='c013'>Paris, meanwhile, grew insufferably
hot; his anxiety to leave it, and his
desire for home became so strong—partaking
of the feverish longing of illness—that
in the hope that the short sea voyage
might prove rather beneficial to him than
the contrary, it was at last decided that
they should set out for Arlingford. They
went down the Seine by water, and then
hired a vessel to take them to Pool, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>was within only twelve miles of their own
home. The voyage seemed to do Fitzhenry
good, the sea air to refresh him;
and, on his near approach to Arlingford,
his spirits and animation seemed to return;
and Emmeline gazed with delight
on the colour in his cheeks, and the
sparkling gladness of his eyes; and oh!
how eloquent was their language to her
doating heart! what volumes did they
tell in one single glance!</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps many would not understand
the emotion which made both their
hearts beat even to pain, when they
entered the well-known scenes of Arlingford;—but,
again I repeat it, I address
myself only to those who have known the
deep feeling of tried affection, the wild
enchantment of love. Emmeline fancied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>she saw sympathetic joy in every countenance,
and as she returned the congratulatory
salutations of the country people,
(who, smiling, took off their hats as the
carriage passed,) she could scarcely restrain
her tears. At how many a turn in
the road, or well-remembered path or ride,
recalling moments and feelings of past
unhappiness, did they almost involuntarily
look at each other; and how often
did Fitzhenry clasp Emmeline’s hand in
his, and entreat her again and again to
forgive him!</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus buoyant with joy and gratitude,
they at last drove up to the door of their
own home. Fitzhenry’s spirits had been
so much beyond his bodily strength, that
they had quite exhausted him; so that
when he left the carriage, it was with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>difficulty he reached the drawing-room.
As the servants all eagerly pressed forward
to give him their assistance, “Poor
Reynolds!” he exclaimed, tears starting
into his eyes, “I wish I had his arm to
lean on now, for how happy he would
have been!”</p>

<p class='c013'>When he was assisted to the couch in
the drawing-room, he looked round the
apartment for several minutes in silence,
and when the door had closed on the
attendants, he held out his arms to Emmeline.
They could neither speak—but
they did not need words to express their
feelings; both knew what was passing in
the mind of the other, and Emmeline secretly
thanked the giver of all good for
her present happiness.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>We poor mortals do well to catch at
each passing moment of joy, and feed
on them while ours; for alas! how soon
do they fade away! and how wretched
the condition of those who, weak in faith,
see not the bounty of God in every blessing,
and cannot “lift the adoring eye
e’en to the storm that wrecks them,”
relying on the wisdom and mercy of his
unsearchable providence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fitzhenry had a restless night of cough
and fever; and although Emmeline attributed
both to the fatigue and agitation
of the preceding day, yet she sent off
an express for an eminent physician residing
at Winchester; and on his arrival,
with a beating heart, led him into her
husband’s apartment. Doctor Harrington,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>who had formerly often seen Fitzhenry,
appeared much struck with the
alteration in his appearance: he questioned
him minutely as to his cough,
and other symptoms of his complaint;
then, drawing out his watch, he repeatedly
counted his pulse. Emmeline,
who in breathless anxiety watched
every look and word, could not help
taking fright at his manner; and her
alarm was increased, when, on pretence
of writing a prescription, he followed her
into the adjoining room, and addressed
her with—“Pray, Lady Fitzhenry, do I
remember right, was not the late Lady
Arlingford consumptive?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Emmeline’s blood froze in her
veins, and her pale lips betrayed the
terror his question had conveyed.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“I beg you will not be alarmed,”
he added, in a sententious tone, observing
her emotion; “Lord Fitzhenry is
young; has always, I believe, lived most
temperately. At present, I apprehend no
immediate danger; but we must be careful.
These hereditary complaints are
sometimes obstinate, and difficult to deal
with.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And thus he went on for some time
with the <i>sang froid</i> which some of his
profession, perhaps naturally, acquire;
fancying he could in that manner reassure
his trembling auditor. But she
scarcely heard him. The sudden transition
from joy and the overflowings of
her grateful heart, to the dreadful apprehensions
which now took possession of
her mind, was too violent to be endured.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Almost unconscious what she did, she
received from Doctor Harrington’s hand
his written prescription; and, with an
altered countenance, returned to her
husband. The flushed crimson of his
cheek, the bright, feverish sparkling of
his eyes, now made her shudder; and
she hid her face at the back of the arm-chair
in which he was sitting, fearing
she might betray herself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, Emmeline,” said he at last,
“what news from Doctor Harrington?
he looked prodigiously pompous about
me; but I hope he will give me something
to stop my cough, and make me
sleep: in fact, that is all I now require
to be well. But it is wearisome. Last
night I never closed my eyes: however,
I believe that was the effect of happiness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>at being once more at Arlingford,
and with you. What does the sapient
doctor recommend? Let me look at
what he has written. This is all Greek
and Hebrew to me,” said he, in a light
tone, as he returned the paper to Emmeline;
“indeed, I hope, for my learning’s
credit, even more unintelligible—but,
Emmeline, are you not well? how
pale you look! I think you require a
little doctoring as well as myself. You
have worn yourself out by nursing me; I
will not let you do so any more. Last
night you did not leave my room for
hours, I know, for I watched you, and
at last was forced to feign sleep, in order
that you might go and get some
yourself. But this shall not be any
longer. I really do not now want my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>servant, or, indeed, any attendance.
We will have that little couch-bed moved
into my room for you; and no soporific
which the doctor can recommend, will
make me sleep half so well, as knowing
you have that rest which I am
sure you need even more than myself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline hid her face on the cushion
on which his head was lying—she could
not speak.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What, Emmeline!” he continued,
“will you not agree to my proposal?
Have I said any thing to displease you?
Foolish girl!” and he drew away her
hands, that were hiding her face.</p>

<p class='c013'>On beholding it, he looked at her a
moment in silence. His countenance
changed. He took her hand in his,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>raised his eyes to heaven, but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>The apprehensions which Dr. Harrington’s
report, guarded as it was, had
raised in Emmeline’s mind, made her
anxious for further advice; and yet she
feared to alarm Fitzhenry by proposing
it: but at her first word, he understood
her, and calmly said—“Do whatever you
like, whatever will ease <i>your</i> mind.” And
she wrote immediately to Doctor Baillie.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the days that passed till his
arrival, she made an effort to throw back
from her heart the miserable anxiety
that was oppressing it, and to pursue her
usual occupations. Many a burning tear
stole down her cheek in silence and
solitude; but she always met her husband
with a smile; and if he ever saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>traces of her feelings on her countenance,
he forbore noticing them.</p>

<p class='c013'>With sensations of apprehension not to
be described, Emmeline, at last, on the
day he had appointed, saw Baillie drive up
to the door. She felt that her fate hung
on his opinion. Dr. Harrington had come
to meet him; and after a short private
conversation between the two medical
men, they proceeded, with Emmeline,
into their patient’s room. Fitzhenry
welcomed them with cheerfulness; talked
for some time of the news of the day,
and on indifferent subjects, to Baillie;
and then turning to Emmeline, who had
been unequal to the exertion of a single
word during their conversation,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Fitzhenry,” said he, “you
must leave me to say my catechism to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Dr. Baillie alone. I want too to make
serious complaints of you,” added he,
gaily; “of your obstinacy and disobedience;
of the way in which you sit up
all night, destroying your health and
bloom.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Baillie made some attempt at a compliment;
but his kind heart felt for the
anguish he saw painted on her countenance;
and, unable to answer him, Emmeline
in silence left the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those who have felt their very existence
depend on one word, may imagine
how she passed the cruel, anxious, long
half-hour that now elapsed. At length,
the door of her room slowly opened, and
Fitzhenry himself, leaning on his stick,
came in alone. His face was flushed;
and though he forced a smile, on entering,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Emmeline plainly read in it an expression
that was like a death-knell to her
heart and hopes. She flew up to him,
and helped him to a couch. After a moment’s
pause, drawing her towards him—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Emmeline,” said he; “dearest! we
have suffered too much, and too long,
from concealing our feelings from each
other, for me to have courage to undertake
to keep another secret from
you, although it is one which I know
will pain you.” Emmeline’s pallid face
showed she was but too well prepared for
what he was going to say. “I have for
some time suspected my real situation,”
added he; “but I was determined to learn
the truth; and I knew Baillie’s sensible
upright honesty would not, at my serious
request, conceal it from me. I required
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>of him to give me his candid opinion
as to my health.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Fitzhenry paused; Emmeline clung
to him, as if to stifle what more he had
to say; but he continued, though in a
faltering voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I had hoped it might have been
otherwise; I had hoped, for your sake,
that we might have been allowed to live
for some little time at least, happily together;
but that God whom you have
taught me to worship and submit to, no
doubt judges wisely; and, we must, I
fear, look to our approaching, final separation.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At these words, poor Emmeline could
no longer command herself; an agonized
scream escaped from her bursting heart,
as she sank on the floor before him.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>“My Emmeline! my dear Emmeline!”
he cried, endeavouring to raise
her in his feeble arms—“Spare me—I
entreat you—I cannot bear to see you
suffer thus—have pity on me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will, I will,” she almost convulsively
exclaimed, “but this is too—too
much for me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You mistake me, Emmeline,” said
he, endeavouring to calm the agony he had
caused. “There may be hope yet; Baillie
is you know famous for seeing every thing
<i>en noir</i>—he was very plain-spoken with
me, for I forced him to be so; but recollect,
Emmeline,” added he, endeavouring
to cheer his voice, “even Baillie
may be mistaken, and while there is life
there is hope: before winter, we are to
go to a warmer climate; you will pray to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>heaven for me, and your prayers, dearest,
will perhaps be heard. They have already
once restored us to each other;
they may do so again. I should not
have said all this to you, I believe, but
it is so necessary to me now to conceal
nothing from you, that I could not have
borne the load alone; but, for God’s
sake, dear Emmeline, compose yourself,
and for my sake, bear up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And for his sake, she did exert herself;
for of what is the female character not
capable, when nerved by strong affection?
All was settled for their leaving
England the beginning of October, when
they were to repair to Lisbon; till then, it
was thought that the climate of Hampshire
would be better for Fitzhenry than that
of Portugal. The season was unusually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>fine; and, sometimes, when well enough
to wander a little way from the house,
the balmy air, and cheering sounds and
sights of a fine autumn, seemed to revive
him; and, if ever he prolonged his
walk one yard further than he had done
on the preceding day—if he had ever
appeared rather more cheerful—his voice
stronger—Emmeline, to whose young
heart happiness was so necessary, then
again, for the moment, gave way to delightful
anticipations. Had she ventured
to look back, and trace from week to
week the rapid progress of the fatal disease,
that was fast hurrying its victim to
the grave, she could not have indulged
even such momentary gleams of hope,
but then also, she could not have performed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>her hard task with the courage
she did.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fitzhenry was generally calm, and even
cheerful; and he sometimes talked of
what they would do on their return to
Arlingford; and projected alterations
and improvements in the place; but all
such plans for the future, usually ended
in a sigh, and were listened to in mournful
silence by his wretched wife; and although
he thus forced himself to appear
interested in worldly affairs, yet, by the
turn his conversation now commonly
took, it was plain to perceive that the
whole tone of his mind was completely
changed; and when Emmeline proposed
reading to him, he always selected such
books as led to reflection, to God, and
to a future world.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>Their wedding-day, the 19th of August,
was the last on which he left the
house; his exertions to appear cheerful
on that day, had been so much beyond
his strength, that they had exhausted
him. The next, he could not leave his
room. A fortnight more, and he could
scarcely raise himself from his couch.
The end of September came, and the
preparations for their departure for Lisbon
continued to be made, no one having
the heart to countermand them, although
it was very evident to all, that he would
never quit his present home, but for that,
where he would be for ever at rest. As
his bodily strength failed, his mind
seemed to gain fresh vigour, and to soar
above the cares and sufferings of this
transitory life. Resignation was an easier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>task to him, than to the wretched being
who, strong in youth and health, was
doomed to remain in that world from
which she saw her every joy fast departing.
But she never complained; she never
wept; at least, her tears were ever concealed
from him for whom they flowed.
With a steady voice, she read to him of the
peace, the bliss of heaven—of forgiveness
to penitent sinners; and, when she saw
her husband’s eyes raised to that heaven
in humble submission to its decrees, she
clasped her hands beside him in silence;
and if a distinct prayer escaped from her
meek heart, it was to implore that she
might be released with him from this
world of suffering.</p>

<p class='c013'>One night, after she had read to him
that beautiful Essay of Miss Bowdler’s,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>on the Advantages of Sickness: “I
am sure, Emmeline,” said he, in a faint
voice, “it will ever be a comfort and
joy to you to think, that through your
means I have been saved from destruction.
When I think what I was only a
short twelve-month ago, I bless God for
the change, although brought about by
such cruel means. Oh! if I could but
live my life over again,” he added vehemently:
“if I could but feel once more
the strength and health of mind and
body, of which I made so bad a use; if
I could but see you, my own Emmy,
the blooming light-hearted girl you were
when I married you, when I so cruelly
scorned and neglected you, how superlatively
happy I should be. But all is
over now; the past cannot be recalled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>and there is no future for me in this
world; and yet, convinced as I am of
this, do you know that even now I
sometimes, during the long, tedious,
sleepless hours of night, still foolishly
indulge in vain dreams of happiness,
and picture to myself our future life
here; I see you admired by every one—the
charm, the ornament of my home,
(for proud, worldly ideas will still cling
to me.) I fancy I see that innocent
beaming smile I once saw—I hear that
joyous laugh I used to hear till my unkindness
silenced it; in fancy, we ride
together, we <i>waltz</i> together,” said he,
forcing a faint smile: “and this perfect
earthly bliss, which providence offered
me, I rejected and spurned—spurned you,
who would have made my home a heaven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>to me, and not one word of reproach
have I heard from you. Oh, Emmeline,
if you were less kind to me, I believe
I should suffer less bitterly; that smile,
that look of love cuts me to the very
soul. There is only one comfort of
which you have not been deprived by
me, that of an approving conscience,
and the hope of happiness beyond the
grave; for in heaven we shall be again
united, and by your means. I trust
I am not too presumptuous, but the
entire resignation with which I look to
approaching death, though now possessed
of every blessing this world can give, and
the hope with which I anticipate meeting
you, my guardian angel, in the next,
gives me a strong feeling of confidence,
that my past errors are blotted out.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Fitzhenry’s voice became choked, he
sank back and closed his eyes, and for
some time they both remained silent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have talked too much,” he at
length said; “I am rather exhausted,
and at times I feel more low without
knowing why. I think I shall sleep, so
good night; God bless you, my Emmeline:”
and he kissed her pale tear-bedewed
cheek, then turned his head
away, and for about an hour all was
quiet. Fitzhenry never moved, and Emmeline
trusted he was getting some
refreshing rest; he had coughed less
that day, his pulse had appeared to her
to be quieter; and as she clasped her
hands in humble supplication, a faint
gleam of hope even then shot through
her sorrowful heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! God of mercy, if possible, spare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>him!” she ejaculated with such fervency,
that her lips, unconsciously to herself,
uttered the sounds. Fearful that she
might have disturbed him, she went
softly to the couch on which he was
lying. He directly held out to her his
feeble hand: “I am not asleep,” said he,
in a hollow altered tone, that made her
shudder; “I cannot sleep. I heard your
prayer, my Emmeline, but it cannot be;
the decree is past; and, while yet I can,
I have a favour to ask of you, though I
am sure, beforehand, you will grant it.
In my writing-desk you will find a letter—when
I am gone—send it to—to Florence.
Do not start, dearest,—it is my wish, my
last request that you will read it—I have
purposely left it open. But I would like
to die in peace with all—even with her.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>A time may come when, like me, she
may regret the past; and then it will be
a comfort to her to know that I forgave
her the evil she was the cause of to us
both—and also it relieves my heart to
ask forgiveness of her for what injury I
have done, what pain I may have inflicted
upon her. As for you, my own Emmeline,
I know I should only grieve you if I were
to ask for your forgiveness. I am sure I
have it,” said he, as he imprinted a fond
kiss on her quivering lips: “Heaven reward
you with its best blessings! When
you see Pelham again, you will for my
sake be kind to him. Poor Pelham!
he loved me most truly!—he loves you
too, Emmeline.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Fitzhenry paused, and fixed his languid,
glazing eyes on her face; he seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>as if anxious to say more, but he only
sighed deeply; and, after a few minutes’
silence, taking from under the pillow
Emmeline’s prayer-book, which he had
always kept since that day on which he
had renewed to her his marriage vow:
“And now, Emmeline,” said he, “read
to me that prayer for the sick.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In silence she complied, for she had
taught her breaking heart to bear such
trials: she had learnt to stifle her sobs,
to swallow her bitter tears.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blessings on thee, my love,” he said,
when she had finished; “your voice
soothes me; your prayers do me so much
good. But there is still another I would
have you read—that for the dying.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emmeline looked at him aghast—his
countenance had within the last hour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>visibly changed—death was upon it—her
blood chilled in her veins; but,
making a desperate effort, with a tremulous
voice, broken by convulsive sobs,
she began to read. When she came to
these words, “Look graciously on thy
servant, O Lord! give him unfeigned repentance
for the errors of his past life,”
Fitzhenry’s hand pressed Emmeline’s
more closely with a sort of nervous, convulsive
grasp. She continued to read—his
hand stiffened—grew cold——all
was over——.</p>

<p class='c013'>A loud shriek brought the attendants
from the adjoining room: they raised
poor Emmeline’s lifeless form from the
ground; with difficulty unloosed her hand
from that of her husband, and carried
her to her bed.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>When consciousness, after a lapse
of some days, at length returned, she
saw her father and mother hanging over
her—but Fitzhenry, her adored Fitzhenry,
was for ever shrouded in the
close, cold habitation of death!</p>

<p class='c018'><i>Extract from a Letter from the Rev. E. Pelham,
to Sir George Pelham, minister at Vienna.</i></p>
<div class='lh c009'>

<p class='c020'>——“You ask me if I can tell you
any thing of Lady Fitzhenry. Being
some little time ago on a visit to a friend
at Poole, and anxious to be able to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>you some more satisfactory account than
mere common report, I resolved to drive
over one Sunday, and attend divine
service at the parish church of Arlingford,
as I was told that she was generally
there to be seen; and, hearing she
lived perfectly retired, I did not like to
intrude upon her with the offer of a visit.</p>
<p class='c019'>“You know it is now nearly a twelve-month
since the death of poor Fitzhenry.
The pew belonging to the Arlingford family,
the pulpit, and communion table, are
all still covered with black, and with the
escutcheons and arms of the Fitzhenrys.
When the church-bell had done ringing,
Lady Fitzhenry, with her father and mother,
came into the gallery. A deep
black veil at first hid her face and
nearly her whole person; but the church
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>growing very hot, she at length put it
aside.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Had I not previously known who it
was, I certainly should not have recognised
her. There is no trace of the
laughing eyes, of the dimpled cheek, of
the fresh gay young countenance, which
I was acquainted with. Perhaps it was
partly owing to contrast and to the quantity
of black by which she was surrounded,
but I thought I had never seen
so pale a face. Still, though she has
already lost much of the fresh beauty of
youth, there is a charm in her faded sadness—an
air of sentiment over her whole
person, that more than compensates.
Her hair was parted back on her marble-white
forehead; and the only thing about
her that was not black, was a gold chain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>to which was hung a small watch. I am
thus particular, for I know you wish for
particulars—and I certainly never before
paid such attention to the minutiæ of a
woman’s dress.</p>

<p class='c019'>“During the service, Lady Fitzhenry
appeared engrossed by it as one whose
heart’s home is in heaven. When it was
ended, all seemed respectfully to wait to
let her pass; the village children eagerly
watching for an opportunity to catch her
eye in order to make their little obeisances,
in the hope of a smile or kind
word from her in return. I too might
then have spoken to her, but a deep
feeling of respect for her sorrows restrained
me. I feared the sight of me
might recall past days, and I did not
like to intrude upon her.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>“When all were gone, I still loitered
in the church, and the clergyman and
I at last were left alone. Seeing me
examining the Fitzhenry arms with interest,
he came up to me; and, after some
usual civilities had passed, I asked him
whether Lord Fitzhenry was buried in
the church.</p>

<p class='c019'>“‘Yes!’ he replied, pointing to a
marble slab; ‘beneath that stone is the
family vault. It is now about a year since
I read over it the funeral service: and
many such sad duties have I performed,
many melancholy scenes of death have
I been witness to; but never, I think,
will the impression of that day be effaced
from my memory. I remember it was
unusually fine for the season, the bright
sun forming such a striking contrast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>with the scene. It seemed to be a gratification
to Lord Arlingford’s feelings to
pay every possible outward mark of respect
to his son, and in every way to
testify his deep affliction for his loss;
and, with this idea, he desired that no
expense might be spared at his funeral.
‘I don’t think that would have been the
way in which I should have indulged
my grief,’ added the respectable old
pastor; ‘but we show our feelings differently;’
and certainly nothing could be
more impressive than the sight of the
long funeral procession, and the waving
of the black banners and plumes, when
moving slowly down the avenue that
leads from the house to the village.
The whole parish, even the county for
many miles round attended; for Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>Fitzhenry was much and justly beloved—and
many too of course came
for the mere show. Of all this costly
dismal pageant, what struck me with
the strongest feelings of melancholy was,
the hearse, drawn by Lord Fitzhenry’s
own beautiful horses, which by his father’s
orders had been trained to a slow
pace for the purpose; but, although pains
had been taken to break them into their
mournful duty, yet, excited and fretted
I suppose by the crowd around them,
and the trappings with which they were
covered, it was with difficulty they could
be restrained; and when, at last, they
were stopped at the gate of the church-yard,
they proudly pawed the ground,
and tossed their heads, as in the days
when they drew their master in all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>pride of youth and health, totally unconscious
of the last sad office they
were then performing for him. Lord
Arlingford and Mr. Benson both attended,
and were much affected at the
ceremony, particularly the latter.</p>

<p class='c019'>“‘Late in the evening, I was,’ continued
my narrator—‘roused from no agreeable
reverie, by being told that Lord Arlingford’s
carriage was driving through the
village towards the church, and that one of
the servants had come to beg that the door
of it might be opened without delay; I
immediately hurried thither. It was a
bright moonlight night, and I saw Mr. and
Mrs. Benson, who had already left the
carriage, help out of it an almost lifeless
figure; they supported her along—for,
as you may guess it was poor Lady Fitzhenry.
It seems, that nothing could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>divert her from the idea of visiting the
vault before it was again closed, and at
last the desire became so strong, that
they thought it best to comply with her
wishes. Her hysteric screams, when
she threw herself on the coffin, still
ring in my ears; and it was with difficulty
they tore her away from it. Twice,
as if agony of mind had given her more
than usual strength, of body, she broke
from them. I really feared for her reason,
under the influence of such wild
despair, and at length, by force, we carried
her back to the carriage. By Mrs.
Benson’s desire, I accompanied them
to the house: she wished to try the
effects of my prayers and exhortations
on the poor sufferer. When she
was laid on her couch, and had been
given some composing medicine, I went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>to her. It seemed as if all was then over
with her in this world. Not a tear fell
from her fixed eyes. ‘He is gone—quite
gone—I shall never see him again—never—never,’
she repeated, apparently quite
unconscious of her words, and with a horrible
composure of voice, although there
was wildness in her looks; for she appeared
as if gazing on some invisible
form. I knelt by her, I read, I said all
that I thought was most likely to rouse
her from her stupor of grief, and move
her feelings; and at last, after one or
two convulsive heavings of her bosom,
tears came to her relief. She fell sobbing
into her mother’s arms; and I left
that excellent mother to give her all the
comfort she was then capable of receiving,
that of sympathy and affection.’</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>“The kind-hearted old man here
stopped, much overcome with his recollections.</p>

<p class='c019'>“‘Lady Fitzhenry has, I believe, resided
here ever since the death of her
husband?’ I said, as soon as I saw he
had sufficiently recovered himself.
‘Yes,’ he replied: ‘by agreement, and
the wording of the deed, which, at the
time of Lord and Lady Fitzhenry’s marriage,
saved this estate from falling into
the hands of Lord Arlingford’s creditors,
(it not being, like the rest of the property,
entailed,) it became hers in the event of
their having no children.’ ‘Does she do
much good here?’ I enquired: ‘has she
taken to the only employment left for
the unhappy?’ ‘Oh! she is the friend
and hope of all the poor of the neighbourhood,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>rejoined the good pastor with
fervency: ‘at first, indeed, she was so
absorbed by her grief, that she seemed
to heed nothing which was passing
around her, and I have seen her mechanically
bestow charity to any one who
chanced to cross her path; but her good
mother gradually brought her to make it
the occupation and interest of her life.
Alas! I fear she has now no other. She
is indefatigable in her exertions to do
good; and may the happiness she bestows
on others be at length repaid back
on herself, and at least bring her peace
and comfort, if not enjoyment! I understand
she is in general quite calm,
and even, at times, cheerful; she never,
in the most distant manner, alludes to
her loss, or to the past year of her life,
and hastily turns off all conversation that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>can possibly lead to any circumstance
connected with it; even with her parents,
since the very first, she has
maintained this same reserve. It seems
as if her husband’s memory was buried
within her own heart, and that she felt
the grave had shut too close over such
an adored being for its sacredness ever
to be disturbed.’ I further learnt from
my companion, that Mr. Benson has
given up all share both in his mercantile
concerns and in the banking-house;
that his spirits and health seem to be
both much broken; that he has lost all
his bustling activity, and that he has just
purchased a small place in the neighbourhood
of Arlingford, intending there
to pass the remainder of his days.</p>

<p class='c019'>“By this time, we had reached the
door of the parsonage; its owner invited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>me in, but I had already loitered much,
and could delay my departure no longer.
Finding that I could return to my
place of destination by crossing Arlingford
Park, I gave my name at the lodge,
and being admitted, although not without
difficulty, I drove as near the house as
I could venture. The hatchment darkened
the windows of the principal room—many
of the others were closed. How
different the whole place looked from
what it did only a few months back,
when I met you there at the time of the
large shooting party which Fitzhenry
had collected! Poor fellow! I used to
abuse him then for his strange unaccountable
conduct and coldness towards
his pretty, interesting little wife; but I
believe others had worked upon him and
done mischief there. The place seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>kept in good order as formerly; but all
was silent, and had a look of desertion.
I did not see a living creature, except
some horses at grass, which I recognized
to be Fitzhenry’s favourite hunters.
They eagerly pricked up their ears when
I past, and threw back their long-neglected
manes, as if a carriage was
now an unusual sight; but when I had
driven by, they quietly returned to their
food.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I travelled on many miles before
I could get poor Lady Fitzhenry out of
my head; pondering too with some
compunction on a silly report to which
I had carelessly given credence. The
said report concerned her and you;
for you must know, George, that the
thoughtless, gossiping world, judging
by its own unfeeling self, even while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Lady Fitzhenry is still shaded by her
weeds, and you are closely fixed at your
political post at Vienna, have already
married you to each other.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Remember, I am not so indiscreet
as to ask how far this story comes home
to yourself. That you admired Lady
Fitzhenry was certainly very evident to
my observation; but how far that admiration
may lead you in forming wishes
for the future, I can’t pretend to say.
Indeed, I almost fear the account I have
now been giving, may destroy, or at least
throw the gloom of doubt over some
flattering vision of connubial bliss. For,
(I may be mistaken,) but if I can judge
of woman’s countenance, and by it of
woman’s constancy, I should say, the
first could never beam with joy again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>and that her every affection is for ever
buried in the grave of her husband.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Time will prove whether I am right;
for your sake, I hope I am not.”</p>

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
